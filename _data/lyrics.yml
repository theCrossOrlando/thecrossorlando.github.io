    [Verse 1]
    You hold the reigns on the sun and the moon
    Like horses driven by kings
    You cover the mountains, the valleys below
    With the breadth of Your mighty wings

    [Pre-Chorus]
    All treasures of wisdom
    And things to be known
    Are hidden inside Your hand
    And in this fortunate turn of events
    You ask me to be Your friend
    Ask me to be Your friend

    [Chorus]
    And You
    You are my first
    You are my last
    You are my future and my past

    Yeah You
    You are my first
    You are my last
    You are my future and my past

    [Verse 3]
    The constellations are swimming inside
    The breadth of Your desire
    So where could I run, where could I hide
    From Your heart’s jealous fire?

    Heavenly Father
    You always amaze me
    Let Your kingdom come in my world
    And in my life

    Give me the food I need to live through today
    And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

    Lead me far from temptation
    Deliver me from the evil one

    I look out the window
    The birds are composing
    Not a note is out of tune
    Or out of place

    I walk to the meadow
    And stare at the flowers
    Better dressed than any girl
    On her wedding day

    So why should I worry?
    Why do I freak out?
    God knows what I need!
    You know what I need!

    Your love is strong

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is now advancing
    Invade my heart
    Invade this broken town

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is buried treasure
    Would you sell yourself
    To buy the one you've found?

    Two things You told me
    That You are strong
    And You love me
    Yes You love me

    Your love is strong

    Our God in heaven
    Hallowed be thy name above all names
    Your kingdom come
    Your will be done

    Before the throne of God above
    I have a strong and perfect plea.
    A great high Priest whose Name is Love
    Who ever lives and pleads for me
    My name is graven on His hands
    My name is written on His heart.
    I know that while in Heaven He stands
    No tongue can bid me thence depart
    My life is hid with Christ on high

    When Satan tempts me to despair
    And tells me of the guilt within
    Upward I look and see Him there
    Who made an end of all my sin
    Because the sinless Savior died
    My sinful soul is counted free
    For God the just is satisfied
    To look on Him and pardon me.

    Behold Him there the risen Lamb
    My perfect spotless righteousness
    The great unchangeable I AM
    The King of glory and of grace,
    One with Himself I cannot die
    My soul is purchased by His blood,
    My life is hid with Christ on high

    You call me out upon the waters
    The great unknown where feet may fail
    And there I find You in the mystery
    In oceans deep
    My faith will stand

    And I will call upon Your name
    And keep my eyes above the waves
    When oceans rise
    My soul will rest in Your embrace
    For I am Yours and You are mine

    Your grace abounds in deepest waters
    Your sovereign hand
    Will be my guide
    Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
    You've never failed and You won't start now

    So I will call upon Your name
    And keep my eyes above the waves
    When oceans rise
    My soul will rest in Your embrace
    For I am Yours and You are mine

    Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
    Let me walk upon the waters
    Wherever You would call me
    Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
    And my faith will be made stronger

    Oh, Jesus, you're my God!

    I will call upon Your name

    That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
    May brighter, fairer be.

    I trace the rainbow through the rain,

    Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,

    Simply to the cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress;
    Helpless look to Thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
