  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    How deep the Father's love for us
    How vast beyond all measure
    That He would give His only Son
    To make a wretch His treasure
    How great the pain of searing loss
    The Father turns His face away
    As wounds which mar the chosen One
    Bring many sons to glory

    Behold the Man upon a cross
    My guilt upon His shoulders
    Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
    Call out among the scoffers
    It was my sin that held Him there
    Until it was accomplished
    His dying breath has brought me life
    I know that it is finished

    I will not boast in anything
    No gifts, no powr's, no wisdom
    But I will boast in Jesus Christ
    His death and resurrection
    Why should I gain from His  reward?
    I cannot give an answer
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom
    Why should I gain from His reward?
    I cannot give an answer
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom

  lyrics: |-
    Let no one caught in sin remain
    Inside the lie of inward shame
    We fix our eyes upon the cross
    And run to Him who showed great love

    And bled for us
    Freely You've bled for us

    Christ is risen from the dead
    Trampling over death by death
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Christ is risen from the dead
    We are one with Him again
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Beneath the weight of all our sin
    You bowed to none but Heaven's will
    No scheme of Hell, no scoffer's crown
    No burden great can hold You down

    In strength You reign
    Forever let Your church proclaim

    Christ is risen from the dead
    Trampling over death by death
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Christ is risen from the dead
    We are one with Him again
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    O death, where is your sting?
    O hell, where is your victory?
    O church, come stand in the light
    The glory of God has defeated the night

    Sing it, o death, where is your sting?
    O hell, where is your victory?
    O church, come stand in the light
    Our God is not dead, He's alive, He's alive

    Christ is risen from the dead
    Trampling over death by death
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Christ is risen from the dead
    We are one with Him again
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Christ is risen from the dead
    Trampling over death by death
    Come awake, come awake
    Come and rise up from the grave

    Christ is risen from the dead
    We are one with Him again

    Support me in the whelming flood.
    When all around my soul gives way,
    He then is all my Hope and Stay.

    On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
    All other ground is sinking sand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    When He shall call with trumpet sound,

  lyrics: |-
    We are loved at the end of our rope
    When we're less there is more of the Lord
    In the fight for our souls we must learn to let go
    And abandon who we are

    We are loved when we feel all is lost
    When the shadows are cast on the cross
    Only then can we know the embrace of the one
    Who's carried us along

    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed

    We are loved when we feel most content
    With who we are, nothing more nothing less
    We'll inherit the earth declaring Your worth
    Bring glory to Your name

    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed

    We're blessed, we're loved
    Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice
    We're blessed, we're loved
    Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice

- song: Good Good Father
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
    But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night
    And you tell me that you're pleased
    And that I'm never alone

    You're a good good father
    It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
    And I'm loved by you
    It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

    I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
    But I know we're all searching
    For answers only you provide
    'Cause you know just what we need
    Before we say a word

    You're a good good father
    It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
    And I'm loved by you
    It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

    Because you are perfect in all of your ways
    You are perfect in all of your ways
    You are perfect in all of your ways to us

    You are…

- song: Your Love Is Strong
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Heavenly Father
    You always amaze me
    Let Your kingdom come in my world
    And in my life

    Give me the food I need to live through today
    And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

    Lead me far from temptation
    Deliver me from the evil one

    I look out the window
    The birds are composing
    Not a note is out of tune
    Or out of place

    I walk to the meadow
    And stare at the flowers
    Better dressed than any girl
    On her wedding day

    So why should I worry?
    Why do I freak out?
    God knows what I need!
    You know what I need!

    Your love is strong

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is now advancing
    Invade my heart
    Invade this broken town

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is buried treasure
    Would you sell yourself
    To buy the one you've found?

    Two things You told me
    That You are strong
    And You love me,
    Yes You love me

    Your love is strong

    Our God in heaven
    Hallowed be thy name above all names
    Your kingdom come
    Your will be done
    On earth as it is in heaven
    Give us, today, our daily bread
    Forgive us weary sinners
    Keep us far from our vices and
    Deliver us from these prisons

  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    This is My Father's World
    This is my father's world
    And to my listening ears
    All nature sings, and round me rings
    The music of the spheres

    This is my father's world
    I rest me in the thought
    Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
    His hand the wonders wrought

    This is my father's world
    Dreaming, I see His face
    Open my eyes, and in glad surprise
    Cry "The Lord is in this place"

    This is my father's world
    From the shining courts above
    The beloved One, His only Son
    Came a pledge of deathless love

    This is my Father’s world
    Oh, let me ne’er forget
    That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
    God is the ruler yet.
    This is my Father’s world,
    The battle is not done
    Jesus who died shall be satisfied,
    And earth and Heav’n be one.

    As I rise, strength of God
    Go before, lift me up
    As I wake, eyes of God
    Look upon, be my sight

    As I wait, heart of God
    Satisfy and sustain
    As I hear, voice of God
    Lead me on, and be my guide
    And be my guide

    Above and below me
    Before and behind me
    In every eye that sees me
    Christ be all around me
    Above and below me
    Before and behind me
    In every eye that sees me
    Christ be all around me
    Whoa...Whoa...Christ be all around me

    As I go, hand of God
    My defense, by my side
    As I rest, breath of God
    Fall upon, bring me peace
    Bring me peace

    Your life, Your death
    Your blood was shed
    For every moment
    Every moment

  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Amazing grace
    How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost, but now I'm found
    Was blind, but now I see

    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
    And grace my fears relieved
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed

    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The Lord has promised good to me
    His word my hope secures
    He will my shield and portion be
    As long as life endures

    [2x]
    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
    The sun forbear to shine
    But God, Who called me here below,
    Will be forever mine.
    Will be forever mine.
    You are forever mine.
