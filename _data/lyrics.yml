    Joy to The world! the Lord is come
    Let earth receive her King
    Let ev'ry heart prepare him room
    And heaven and nature sing
    And heaven and nature sing
    And heaven and nature sing

    Joy to the world! the Savior reigns
    Let men their songs employ
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
    Repeat the sounding joy
    Repeat the sounding joy
    Repeat the sounding joy

    No more let sins and sorrows grow
    Nor thorns infest the ground
    He comes to make His blessings flow
    Far as the curse is found, far as the curse is found
    Far as, far as the curse is found

    He rules the world with truth and grace
    And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness
    And wonders of His love
    And wonders of His love
    And wonder wonders of His love

  lyrics: |-
    I was an orphan lost at the Fall
    Running away when I'd hear Your call
    But Father, You worked Your will
    I had no righteousness of my own
    I had no right to draw near Your throne
    But Father, You loved me still

    And in love before You laid the world's foundation
    You predestined to adopt me as Your own
    You have raised me so high up above my station
    I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone

    You left Your home to seek out the lost
    You knew the great and terrible cost
    But Jesus, Your face was set
    I worked my fingers down to the bone
    Nothing I did could ever atone
    But Jesus, You paid my debt

    By Your blood, I have redemption and salvation
    Lord, You died that I might reap what You have sown
    And You rose that I might be a new creation
    I am born again by grace and grace alone

    I was in darkness all of my life
    I never knew the day from the night
    But Spirit, You made me see
    I swore I knew the way on my own
    Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone
    But Spirit, You moved in me

    At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
    On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
    Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
    Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone

    So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone
    I will run the race by grace and grace alone
    I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone
    I will reach the end by grace and grace alone

    Fullness of God in helpless babe
    This gift of love and righteousness
    Scorned by the ones He came to save
    'Til on that cross as Jesus died
    The wrath of God was satisfied
    For every sin on Him was laid
    Here in the death of Christ I live, I live

    There in the ground His body lay
    Light of the world by darkness slain
    Then bursting forth in glorious Day
    Up from the grave He rose again
    And as He stands in victory
    Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
    For I am His and He is mine

    Nothing on the land or underneath
    Oh nothing that could ever come between
    The love You have for me

    I could lay my head in Sheol
    I could make my bed
    At the bottom of darkness deep
    Oh but there is not a place I could escape You

    Your heart won't stop, coming after me
    Your heart won't stop, coming after me
    Your heart won't stop, coming after me
    Coming after me

    There is not an angel of the stars,
    There is not a devil in the dark
    Oh nothing that could change the way You are,
    Or the love You have for me

    I could lay my head in Sheol
    I could make my bed
    At the bottom of darkness deep
    Oh but there is not a place I could escape You

    Bless the Lord O my soul

    Worship His Holy name
    Sing like never before

    The sun comes up

    It’s time to sing Your song again
    Whatever may pass
    And whatever lies before me
    Let me be singing
    When the evening comes

    You’re rich in love
    And You’re slow to anger
    Your name is great
    And Your heart is kind
    For all Your goodness
    I will keep on singing
    Ten thousand reasons
    For my heart to find

    And on that day
    When my strength is failing
    The end draws near
    And my time has come
    Still my soul will
    Sing Your praise unending

  lyrics: |-
    Before the throne of God above
    I have a strong and perfect plea.
    A great high Priest whose Name is Love
    Who ever lives and pleads for me

    My name is graven on His hands
    My name is written on His heart.
    I know that while in Heaven He stands
    No tongue can bid me thence depart
    My life is hid with Christ on high

    When Satan tempts me to despair
    And tells me of the guilt within
    Upward I look and see Him there
    Who made an end of all my sin
    Because the sinless Savior died
    My sinful soul is counted free
    For God the just is satisfied
    To look on Him and pardon me.

    Behold Him there the risen Lamb
    My perfect spotless righteousness
    The great unchangeable I AM
    The King of glory and of grace,
    One with Himself I cannot die
    My soul is purchased by His blood,
    My life is hid with Christ on high

    There is another in the fire

    All my debt left for dead beneath the waters

    How good You've been to me
    I'll count the joy come every battle

    And I can see the light in the darkness
    As the darkness bows to Him
    I can hear the roar in the heavens
    As the space between wears thin
    I can feel the ground shake beneath us
    As the prison walls cave in
    Nothing stands between us
    Nothing stands between us

    There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
    He who was and still is, and will be through it all
    So come what may in the space between

    No syllable empty or void
    For once You have spoken
    All nature and science follow the sound of Your voice

    And as You speak
    A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
    Evolving in pursuit of what You said
    If it all reveals Your nature so will I
    I can see Your heart in everything You say
    Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
    If creation still obeys You so will I
    So will I

    If the stars were made to worship so will I
    If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
    If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
    For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
    If the wind goes where You send it so will I
    If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
    If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
    Then we’ll sing again a hundred billion times, whoa

    God of salvation
    You chased down my heart
    Through all of my failure and pride
    On a hill You created
    The light of the world
    Abandoned in darkness to die

    And as You speak
    A hundred billion failures disappear
    Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
    If You left the grave behind You so will I
    I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done
    Every part designed in a work of art called love
    If You gladly chose surrender so will I
    I can see Your heart
    Eight billion different ways
    Every precious one
    A child You died to save
    If You gave Your life to love them so will I

    Like You would again a hundred billion times
    But what measure could amount to Your desire
    You’re the One who never leaves the one behind

    When it feels like surgery
    And it burns like third degree
    And you wonder what is it worth?
    When your insides breaking in
    And you feel that ache again
    And you wonder
    What's giving birth?

    If you could let the pain of the past go
    Of your soul
    None of this is in your control

    If you could only let your guard down
    You could learn to trust me somehow
    I swear, that I won't let you go
    If you could only let go your doubts
    If you could just believe in me now
    I swear, that I won't let you go
    I won't let you go

    When your fear is currency
    And you feel that urgency
    You want peace but there's war in your head
    Maybe that's where life is born
    When our façades are torn
    Pain gives birth to the promise ahead

    If you could let the pain of the past go
    Of your soul
    None of this is in your control

    If you could only let your guard down
    If you could learn to trust me somehow
    I swear, that I won't let you go
    If you could only let go your doubts
    If you could just believe in me now

    I won't let you go
    I'll always be by your side

    If you could only let your guard down
    If you could learn to trust me somehow
    I swear, that I won't let you go
    If you could only let go your doubts
    If you could just believe in me now
    I swear, that I won't let you go
    I won't let you go
    (I won't let you go)

    There ain't no darkness strong enough that could tear you out from my heart
    There ain't no strength that's strong enough that could tear this love apart

    I'm never gonna let you go

    All: O God, You who created us all in Your image, who knew us all before we were born, affirm in us the value Your love has unquestionably given to us.  As we embody our core identity found in you, may those who are dehumanized, either by the oppression others or by their own actions of hate, be granted the permission to live in the freedom you offer—By Your compassion grant us what we need—the courage necessary to love boldly, the vulnerability necessary to trust, the submission necessary to heal, the conviction necessary to repent. We belong to You.

    Time of Confession

    L: Let us confess our sins before the Lord. Respond together by saying, “Forgive us O Lord.”

    L: For the times when we have been too consumed by our own pain or distracted by the tasks of life to see and respond to the deaths of those You hold dear,

    A: Forgive us, O Lord

    L: For the times our own hearts desire to hate those who cause us pain,

    A: Forgive us, O Lord

    L: For ways we have not welcomed You into our suffering and disappointment, so that we might forgive,

    A: Forgive us, O Lord

    L: For the ways we have caused You and others pain—for our own sin…

    A: Forgive us, O Lord

    A: Your peace be with us, O Lord

    Prayer of Lamentation

    L: Great God of love, your creation weeps.

    A: Hear the cry of the voiceless.

    A: Bless those who grieve and mourn the broken kingdom on Earth.

    L: “It’s the Holy Spirit’s role to convict, God’s role to judge, and ours to love.”

    A: We ask that you help us to love.

    L: We release the resentment and bitterness we hold towards people who have hurt us, people like us and our friends.

  lyrics: |-
    Let us pray for the whole Church of God in Christ Jesus and for all people according to their needs, saying: Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    We pray for those who grieve. Heavenly Father, the spirits of everyone who have departed in the faith are with You, and in Your presence there is no more death or mourning or crying or pain. Comfort those who mourn with the certainty that You will come again to gather all Your faithful together at the end of all things. Remind us, in the midst of our sorrow, that the marriage feast of the Lamb — and the joyful reunion with those we love — is coming soon. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    We pray for the world in which we live. Dear Lord God, You made the heavens and the earth and everything in them. Our sin has corrupted Your good world, Father; we ask that You would have mercy on us according to Your good pleasure. Give wisdom to the leaders of the nations — and especially to those in authority in our country — that they would make good and God-pleasing decisions. For the sake of Your people, restrain the madness of war and allow the Good News of Jesus Christ to bring the only peace that really lasts. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    O patient Father, have mercy on the United States as well. So many are lost and separated from You! Lord of glory, it is not Your will that any should be lost, but rather that all people would be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. Send out Your Holy Spirit to enlighten the hearts of rebels and wanderers alike. Demolish the strongholds of Satan’s deceptions — set the prisoners free through faith in the finished work of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    Lord Jesus, when You were on earth, men mocked and abused You, yet You did not retaliate. You blessed those who cursed You. Grant us the same grace — enabling us to give a gentle answer even when we’re unjustly treated — so that wrath can be turned away and Your name honored in everything. Grant us the strength to persevere even unto the end. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    Father, You invite us to call upon You in the day of trouble. Hear us as we pray for those who are sick or suffering. Comfort them in their time of trial. Meet them in their need and, according to Your good pleasure, grant them healing and peace. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    Precious Lord Jesus, as the day of Your suffering drew near, You gathered with Your disciples and gave them — and us! — a precious gift. Under the bread and wine, You give us Your own body and blood for the forgiveness of our sins and the strengthening of our faith. Grant us grace, Jesus, to receive these gifts rightly as we come to Your table. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.

    In joyful expectation of the resurrection to eternal life, we remember before our Lord our departed family and friends who have gone before us in faith and all who are in our hearts and minds this day.

    The names of those to be remembered may be read. A bell may be tolled following the reading of each name.

    Almighty God, we remember with thanksgiving those who loved and served You in Your Church on earth and who now rest from their labors. Keep us in fellowship with all Your saints and bring us at last to the joy of Your heavenly kingdom; through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

  lyrics: |-
    O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
    It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.
    Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
    'Til He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.

    A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
    For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

    Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
    O night div-ine, O night  when Christ was born;
    O night div-ine,  O night, O night Divine.

    Truly He taught us to love one another;
    His law is love and His gospel is peace.
    Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
    And in His name all oppression shall cease.

    Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
    Let all within us praise His holy name.

    Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
    His power and glory evermore proclaim.
    His power and  glory evermore proclaim.

    He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
    Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
    Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!

    Someday you will find me
    Guarded in His fortress
    Open heart and wings
    That never touch the ground
    Someday we will gather
    In a grand reunion
    Debts of this old world
    Are nowhere to be found

    1. My hope is built on nothing less
    Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
    I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
    But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    I rest on His unchanging grace;
    In every high and stormy gale
    My anchor holds within the veil.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    3. His oath, His covenant, and blood
    Support me in the whelming flood;
    When every earthly prop gives way,
    He then is all my Hope and Stay.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    4. When He shall come with trumpet sound,
    Oh, may I then in Him be found,
    Clothed in His righteousness alone,
    Faultless to stand before the throne!
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    I wanna wake and feel Your glory
    I wanna speak in tongues of angels for You Lord

    Better dressed than any girl
    On her wedding day

    Why do I freak out?

    You know what I need!

    Is now advancing
    Invade my heart
    Invade this broken town

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is buried treasure
    Would you sell yourself
