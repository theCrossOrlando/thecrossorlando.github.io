  lyrics: |-
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above

    'Cause all I know
    Is how to cry

  lyrics: |-
    Marvelous grace of our loving Lord
    Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt
    Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured
    There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt!

    Grace, grace, God's grace
    Grace that will pardon and cleanse within!
    Grace, grace, God's grace
    Grace that is greater than all our sin!

    Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold
    Threaten the soul with infinite loss
    Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold
    Points to the refuge, the mighty Cross

    Grace that will pardon and cleanse within!
    Grace, grace, God's grace
    Grace that is greater than all our sin!

    Dark is the stain that we cannot hide
    What can avail to wash it away?
    Look! There is flowing a crimson tide
    Younger than every yesterday

    Grace that will pardon and cleanse within!
    Grace, grace, God's grace
    Grace that is greater than all our sin!

  lyrics: |-
    How deep the Father's love for us
    How vast beyond all measure
    That He would give His only Son
    To make a wretch His treasure
    How great the pain of searing loss
    The Father turns His face away
    As wounds which mar the chosen One
    Bring many sons to glory

    Behold the Man upon a cross
    My guilt upon His shoulders
    Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
    Call out among the scoffers
    It was my sin that held Him there
    Until it was accomplished
    His dying breath has brought me life
    I know that it is finished

    I will not boast in anything
    No gifts, no powr's, no wisdom
    But I will boast in Jesus Christ
    His death and resurrection
    Why should I gain from His  reward?
    I cannot give an answer
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom
    Why should I gain from His reward?
    I cannot give an answer
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom
    But this I know with all my heart
    His wounds have paid my ransom

    I hear the Savior say, “Thy strength indeed is small;
    Child of weakness, watch and pray. Find in Me thine all and all.”

    Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
    Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
    Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and thine alone,
    Can change the leper’s spots And melt this heart of stone.

    Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
    Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

    And when, before the throne I stand in Him complete,
    “Jesus died my soul to save,” My lips shall still repeat.

    Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
    Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

    O praise the One who paid my debt
    And raised this life up from the dead

    Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
    Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
