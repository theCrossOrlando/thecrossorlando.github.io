  lyrics: |-
    I believe in God, the Father almighty,
    creator of heaven and earth.

    I believe in Jesus Christ, God's only Son, our Lord,
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    born of the Virgin Mary,
    suffered under Pontius Pilate,
    was crucified, died, and was buried;
    he descended to the dead.

    On the third day he rose again;
    he ascended into heaven,
    he is seated at the right hand of the Father,
    and he will come to judge the living and the dead.

    I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    the holy catholic Church,
    the communion of saints,
    the forgiveness of sins,
    the resurrection of the body,
    and the life everlasting. Amen.

  lyrics: |-
    Oh, love that will not let me go
    I rest my weary soul in thee
    I give you back the life I owe
    And in your ocean depths its flow
    May richer, fuller be

    My life is not my own
    It's yours
    My life is not my own
    I know it's yours

    Oh, light that follows all my way
    I yield my flickering torch to thee
    And my heart restores its borrowed ray
    That in your sunshine's blaze its day
    May brighter, fairer be

    So light a fire in my heart
    And I'll burn for you
    So light a fire in my heart
    And I'll burn for you

    Oh, joy, that seeks me through the pain
    I cannot close my heart to thee
    I trace the rainbow through the rain
    And feel the promise is not in vain
    That morn shall tearless be

    So anoint me with joy
    And joyful I will be
    So anoint me with joy
    And joyful I will be

    Oh, cross that's lifing up my head
    I dare not ask to fly from thee
    I lay in dust life's glory dead
    And from the ground there blossoms red
    Life that shall endless be

    We will sing:
    Holy, holy
    Is the King of Kings
    And we will sing:
    Holy, holy
    Is the King of Kings

    On that day we will sing:
    We will join with the angels and we will sing:

    I hear the savior say, thy strength indeed is small
    Child of weakness, watch and pray, find in me thine all in all

    All to him I owe
    Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow

    Lord, now indeed I find thy power and thine alone
    Can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone

    'Cause Jesus paid it all

    My sin had left this crimson stain, he washed it white as snow

    It's washed away, all my sin
    And all my shame

    And when before the throne I stand in him complete
    "Jesus died my soul to save" my lips shall still repeat

    Jesus paid it all
    All to him I owe
    (Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow)
    (He washed it white as snow)

    (O praise the one who paid my debt
    And raised this life up from the dead)

    (O praise the one who paid my debt
    And raised this life up from the dead)
    Well praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead
    Jesus
    You are the one
    The son of god
    Conqueror of death
    King of kings
    The sacrificial lamb

    (O praise the one who paid my debt
    And raised this life up from the dead)
    Well praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead

    My name is written on His heart.
    I know that while in Heaven He stands

    And tells me of the guilt within

    Who made an end of all my sin
    Because the sinless Savior died
    My sinful soul is counted free
    For God the just is satisfied
    To look on Him and pardon me.

    Behold Him there the risen Lamb

    Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
    I’ll be satisfied as long
    As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

    Refrain:
    Just a closer walk with Thee,
    Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
    Daily walking close to Thee,
    Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

    In this life of toil and snares,
    If I falter, Lord, who cares?
    Who with me my burden shares?
    None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

    When my feeble life is o’er,
    Time for me will be no more;
    Guide me gently, safely o’er
    To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

    How deep the Father’s love for us,
    How vast beyond all measure,
    That He should give His only Son
    To make a wretch His treasure.
    How great the pain of searing loss -
    The Father turns His face away,
    As wounds which mar the Chosen One
    Bring many sons to glory.

    Behold the man upon a cross,
    My sin upon His shoulders;
    Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
    Call out among the scoffers.
    It was my sin that held Him there
    Until it was accomplished;
    His dying breath has brought me life -
    I know that it is finished.

    I will not boast in anything,
    No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
    But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
    His death and resurrection.
    Why should I gain from His reward?
    I cannot give an answer;
    But this I know with all my heart -
    His wounds have paid my ransom.

    Why do I freak out?
    God knows what I need!
    You know what I need!

    Your love is strong

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is now advancing
    Invade my heart
    Invade this broken town

    The Kingdom of the Heavens
    Is buried treasure
    Would you sell yourself
    To buy the one you've found?

    Two things You told me
    That You are strong
    And You love me,
    Yes You love me

    Your love is strong

    Our God in heaven
    Hallowed be thy name above all names
    Your kingdom come
    Your will be done
    On earth as it is in heaven
    Give us, today, our daily bread
    Forgive us weary sinners
    Keep us far from our vices and
    Deliver us from these prisons

    Hallelujah, give praise, you servants
    Praise the name of the LORD
    Let the name of the LORD be blessed

    From the rising of the sun, to it’s going down
    Let the name of the LORD be praised, from the rising of the sun.

    The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens,
    Who is like the LORD our God? Who sits enthroned on high?
    Who is like the LORD our God? Who stoops to behold,
    The heavens and the earth?

    From the rising of the sun, to it’s going down
    Let the name of the LORD be praised, from the rising of the sun."

    My heart restores its borrowed ray,
    That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
    May brighter, fairer be.

    O Joy that seekest me through pain,
    I cannot close my heart to thee;
    I trace the rainbow through the rain,
    And feel the promise is not vain,
    That morn shall tearless be.

    O Cross that liftest up my head,

    And from the ground there blossoms red
    Life that shall endless be.

    From Thy wounded side which flowed,
    Be of sin the double cure;
    Save from wrath and make me pure.

    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to the cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress;
    Helpless look to Thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    And behold Thee on Thy throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee.
