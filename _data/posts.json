I learned that from the recluse neighbor who recently passed away), during the dry season pull weeds rather than merely mowing them down, trim taller trees to make sure the grass gets enough sun.

They said, why always engage in things with a motivation to improve our situation or position? In some cases one person really doesn’t need another, they could be fine just going forward in life without input or connection to the other. Yet, if they give of their resources or self, they’ll be “no worse off” and the community or effort would be better. Sometimes it’s good to do things, not because we need to or ought to. Sometimes it’s cool to do things, just because we can. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made me think of the time Jesus turned water into wine. He didn’t need to, but he could.

False trials and manipulating the crowds to get the outcomes they wanted. Abandoning friends and hiding in upper rooms to avoid the unknown of arrest. Apathy and feigned powerlessness to avoid the unknown outcome of acting on intuition.

I can’t remember the context or even who I was talking with, just the words they said in response. I was saying something like, ”I would be way less stressed out if I just knew how things were going to turn out.” They said…”of course you would. that’s why they call it faith.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat with the story of the resurrection this year, that was one point that stuck out with me. How nearly everyone around Jesus in those last days was not willing to move into a future that was open ended, or outside of their control. The church leaders wanted to control the way Rome did or didn’t crackdown on them. They wanted to control the activity of the Temple and the worship of the people. When Jesus went in a direction the disciples didn’t understand or expect, rather than move with him into unknown, they just left. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus, on the other hand, just follows the lead of the divine peacefully into the unknown of death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of situations rife with false testimony, apathy, murderous jealousy and greed resulting in the death of Jesus, God successfully implants his reign on earth. Jesus death, resurrection and ascension change the potential within humanity to let God be God forever. We now have the capacity of deep and abiding faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of the reason that the story of the resurrection becomes such and anthem or emblem for the church. It is the pinnacle of faith. Jesus trusts the God even in death. His faith opens the way for each human to faith thereby securing the pathway to the God for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just saying Easter is good news folks. </p>",

I can’t remember the context or even who I was talking with, just the words they said in response. I was saying something like, ”I would be way less stressed out if I just knew how things were going to turn out.” They said…”of course you would. that’s why they call it faith.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat with the story of the resurrection this year, that was one point that stuck out with me. How nearly everyone around Jesus in those last days was not willing to move into a future that was open ended, or outside of their control. The church leaders wanted to control the way Rome did or didn’t crackdown on them. They wanted to control the activity of the Temple and the worship of the people. When Jesus went in a direction the disciples didn’t understand or expect, rather than move with him into unknown, they just left. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus, on the other hand, just follows the lead of the divine peacefully into the unknown of death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of situations rife with false testimony, apathy, murderous jealousy and greed resulting in the death of Jesus, God successfully implants his reign on earth. Jesus death, resurrection and ascension change the potential within humanity to let God be God forever. We now have the capacity of deep and abiding faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of the reason that the story of the resurrection becomes such and anthem or emblem for the church. It is the pinnacle of faith. Jesus trusts the God even in death. His faith opens the way for each human to faith thereby securing the pathway to the God for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just saying Easter is good news folks. </p>"

Something in the way that my teacher walked us through the story, got me thinking deeply about a text. Maybe for the first time. I loved it. It changed the way I thought about study and school. It affected the trajectory college; from engineering/architecture to philosophy/religion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high school senior I never could have predicted that outcome when Mr. Gufford told us that’s what we’d be studying. Yet, I trusted him and engaged the content fully. I could have said Shakespeare sounds boring, I’m going to check out for this one and figure out a different way to pass (ask me how I handled vocabulary tests that year). There are some choices we make that have significant downstream effect…it can be very hard to predict what those will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judas in Gethsemene, Peter in the courtyard, the women at the tomb, Thomas in the upper room: all made choices with downstream effects in significant moments. Still, how many more decisions did they make that brought them there. Me and you make lots of decisions, every day. Large and small. None are insignificant and each is an opportunity for faith. You never know where they will lead.  </p>",

Something in the way that my teacher walked us through the story, got me thinking deeply about a text. Maybe for the first time. I loved it. It changed the way I thought about study and school. It affected the trajectory college; from engineering/architecture to philosophy/religion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high school senior I never could have predicted that outcome when Mr. Gufford told us that’s what we’d be studying. Yet, I trusted him and engaged the content fully. I could have said Shakespeare sounds boring, I’m going to check out for this one and figure out a different way to pass (ask me how I handled vocabulary tests that year). There are some choices we make that have significant downstream effect…it can be very hard to predict what those will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judas in Gethsemene, Peter in the courtyard, the women at the tomb, Thomas in the upper room: all made choices with downstream effects in significant moments. Still, how many more decisions did they make that brought them there. Me and you make lots of decisions, every day. Large and small. None are insignificant and each is an opportunity for faith. You never know where they will lead.  </p>"
