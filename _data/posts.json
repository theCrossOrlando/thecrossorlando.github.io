I learned that from the recluse neighbor who recently passed away), during the dry season pull weeds rather than merely mowing them down, trim taller trees to make sure the grass gets enough sun.

They said, why always engage in things with a motivation to improve our situation or position? In some cases one person really doesn’t need another, they could be fine just going forward in life without input or connection to the other. Yet, if they give of their resources or self, they’ll be “no worse off” and the community or effort would be better. Sometimes it’s good to do things, not because we need to or ought to. Sometimes it’s cool to do things, just because we can. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made me think of the time Jesus turned water into wine. He didn’t need to, but he could.

I can’t remember the context or even who I was talking with, just the words they said in response. I was saying something like, ”I would be way less stressed out if I just knew how things were going to turn out.” They said…”of course you would. that’s why they call it faith.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat with the story of the resurrection this year, that was one point that stuck out with me. How nearly everyone around Jesus in those last days was not willing to move into a future that was open ended, or outside of their control. The church leaders wanted to control the way Rome did or didn’t crackdown on them. They wanted to control the activity of the Temple and the worship of the people. When Jesus went in a direction the disciples didn’t understand or expect, rather than move with him into unknown, they just left. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus, on the other hand, just follows the lead of the divine peacefully into the unknown of death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of situations rife with false testimony, apathy, murderous jealousy and greed resulting in the death of Jesus, God successfully implants his reign on earth. Jesus death, resurrection and ascension change the potential within humanity to let God be God forever. We now have the capacity of deep and abiding faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of the reason that the story of the resurrection becomes such and anthem or emblem for the church. It is the pinnacle of faith. Jesus trusts the God even in death. His faith opens the way for each human to faith thereby securing the pathway to the God for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just saying Easter is good news folks. </p>",

I can’t remember the context or even who I was talking with, just the words they said in response. I was saying something like, ”I would be way less stressed out if I just knew how things were going to turn out.” They said…”of course you would. that’s why they call it faith.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I sat with the story of the resurrection this year, that was one point that stuck out with me. How nearly everyone around Jesus in those last days was not willing to move into a future that was open ended, or outside of their control. The church leaders wanted to control the way Rome did or didn’t crackdown on them. They wanted to control the activity of the Temple and the worship of the people. When Jesus went in a direction the disciples didn’t understand or expect, rather than move with him into unknown, they just left. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus, on the other hand, just follows the lead of the divine peacefully into the unknown of death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of situations rife with false testimony, apathy, murderous jealousy and greed resulting in the death of Jesus, God successfully implants his reign on earth. Jesus death, resurrection and ascension change the potential within humanity to let God be God forever. We now have the capacity of deep and abiding faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of the reason that the story of the resurrection becomes such and anthem or emblem for the church. It is the pinnacle of faith. Jesus trusts the God even in death. His faith opens the way for each human to faith thereby securing the pathway to the God for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just saying Easter is good news folks. </p>"

Something in the way that my teacher walked us through the story, got me thinking deeply about a text. Maybe for the first time. I loved it. It changed the way I thought about study and school. It affected the trajectory college; from engineering/architecture to philosophy/religion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high school senior I never could have predicted that outcome when Mr. Gufford told us that’s what we’d be studying. Yet, I trusted him and engaged the content fully. I could have said Shakespeare sounds boring, I’m going to check out for this one and figure out a different way to pass (ask me how I handled vocabulary tests that year). There are some choices we make that have significant downstream effect…it can be very hard to predict what those will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judas in Gethsemene, Peter in the courtyard, the women at the tomb, Thomas in the upper room: all made choices with downstream effects in significant moments. Still, how many more decisions did they make that brought them there. Me and you make lots of decisions, every day. Large and small. None are insignificant and each is an opportunity for faith. You never know where they will lead.  </p>",

Something in the way that my teacher walked us through the story, got me thinking deeply about a text. Maybe for the first time. I loved it. It changed the way I thought about study and school. It affected the trajectory college; from engineering/architecture to philosophy/religion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high school senior I never could have predicted that outcome when Mr. Gufford told us that’s what we’d be studying. Yet, I trusted him and engaged the content fully. I could have said Shakespeare sounds boring, I’m going to check out for this one and figure out a different way to pass (ask me how I handled vocabulary tests that year). There are some choices we make that have significant downstream effect…it can be very hard to predict what those will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judas in Gethsemene, Peter in the courtyard, the women at the tomb, Thomas in the upper room: all made choices with downstream effects in significant moments. Still, how many more decisions did they make that brought them there. Me and you make lots of decisions, every day. Large and small. None are insignificant and each is an opportunity for faith. You never know where they will lead.  </p>"

I was thinking about how prepared that one kid was. He must have some good parents who sent him out into the wilderness with a good lunch packed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also, then, thinking about the choice all those other families made to keep tracking Jesus and his disciples out into the wilderness. I wonder if any families had already turned back…”It’s getting late, there’s no dinner out here. Let’s go home.” Of course there’s no sin in that decision. It’s actually probably sensible, and yet they missed one of Jesus’ most memorable miracles. But they avoided the anxiety of wondering…will we get to eat tonight?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I have had moments like that in my life. I can remember a couple of key decisions: there’s a sensible choice and a gamble. Of course there’s no virtue in a gamble just for the thrill of it; and theres no wisdom in irresponsible risk. But these memories are not that. These were moments kind of like I’m imagining those families might have had. I could go back, and know what I’ll get…or I could follow Jesus out there. No guarantees on what Jesus will do… but it could be cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any gamble, of course, there is cost. The families that followed Jesus further into the wilderness risked a meal. Pretty small risk I suppose. But I have found that lots of good things start small. We talked about how all four of the Gospels mention this story. I think that may be because so many people witnessed it…also, what happened to all those people? Were they able to keep following the way of Jesus? I imagine, when that small gamble paid off, they ate their fill, some of the families began to risk more on the provision of Jesus. I can’t wait to hear stories from those families one day. What does your life look like when you’ve experienced the provision of Jesus so tangibly? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One principle from the parable of Jesus that has come up a lot for me over the years: he who is faithful with a few things will be faithful with much. As opportunities to follow Jesus present themselves, I try to take the ones I can. I have found, at times, small opportunities can lead to larger ones. Not every time. But for me, some of the coolest experiences I have had come from walking out into some unknowns, because sometimes Jesus really surprises!</p>",

I was thinking about how prepared that one kid was. He must have some good parents who sent him out into the wilderness with a good lunch packed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also, then, thinking about the choice all those other families made to keep tracking Jesus and his disciples out into the wilderness. I wonder if any families had already turned back…”It’s getting late, there’s no dinner out here. Let’s go home.” Of course there’s no sin in that decision. It’s actually probably sensible, and yet they missed one of Jesus’ most memorable miracles. But they avoided the anxiety of wondering…will we get to eat tonight?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I have had moments like that in my life. I can remember a couple of key decisions: there’s a sensible choice and a gamble. Of course there’s no virtue in a gamble just for the thrill of it; and theres no wisdom in irresponsible risk. But these memories are not that. These were moments kind of like I’m imagining those families might have had. I could go back, and know what I’ll get…or I could follow Jesus out there. No guarantees on what Jesus will do… but it could be cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any gamble, of course, there is cost. The families that followed Jesus further into the wilderness risked a meal. Pretty small risk I suppose. But I have found that lots of good things start small. We talked about how all four of the Gospels mention this story. I think that may be because so many people witnessed it…also, what happened to all those people? Were they able to keep following the way of Jesus? I imagine, when that small gamble paid off, they ate their fill, some of the families began to risk more on the provision of Jesus. I can’t wait to hear stories from those families one day. What does your life look like when you’ve experienced the provision of Jesus so tangibly? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One principle from the parable of Jesus that has come up a lot for me over the years: he who is faithful with a few things will be faithful with much. As opportunities to follow Jesus present themselves, I try to take the ones I can. I have found, at times, small opportunities can lead to larger ones. Not every time. But for me, some of the coolest experiences I have had come from walking out into some unknowns, because sometimes Jesus really surprises!</p>"

I love it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I played enough that I can close my eyes and feel what it’s like to swing a bat, or field a ball. I worked hard for those years to program the right muscle memory into my body so I could do the things without even thinking about it. They still have that memory, more than 20 years later…it’s still there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read a note this morning that some people figure that Jesus had a home in Capernaum. They figure he must have had a house because it says that he hosted dinners with questionable folk. If he hosted, he must have had a place. Jesus regularly hung out with ”drunkards and gluttons.” Many of his disciples, and all of his closest friends came from sort of blue collar jobs. When he’s killed it’s between two criminals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus never really explains why he hangs out with so many of the marginalized and poor folk. But he definitely does. Seems almost like muscle memory for him. He’s not hanging with Herod, or Pilate or Caiphas. He’s getting Matthew to leave his tax collector’s booth and rich young rulers to give away their money. You don’t have to be poor to hang with Jesus, but he definitely seems to spend more time with poor folk than anyone else. I wonder why? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t suppose money is bad. But it has been occurring to me lately how much attention money can take from us. Earning it, keeping it, stewarding it, saving it, spending it. It gets to be like muscle memory building our lives around the stuff without even thinking about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what you feel like you’re building your life around?
