With what’s in here, I could make anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past Sunday we spoke about the way Paul, when faced with an open ended departure from the Ephesians, committed them to God.

That came up because we were mentioning the Sermon on the Mount. I don’t know that I’ve ever phrased it exactly like that before, but the understanding comes from a professor I had in Seminary: Prof. Jeffery Gibbs. He understood the beatitudes as nine descriptors of followers of Jesus. We all mourn, are meek and want to be righteous. We all are merciful, pure in heart and are peacemakers. Of course not perfectly or all the time. Professor Gibbs said this is why “Blessed are the poor in sprint for theirs is the kingdom of God,” came first. That affirmation points to the reality that, with respect to spiritual things, we are all poor. We can not will ourselves to be merciful or pure of Heart or peacemakers perfectly, all the time. We don’t have the resources to manage appropriate meekness in every situation we can’t always conjure a desire for righteousness. If we’re going to approach living like followers of Jesus, we’re going to have to recognize our limitations. Jesus is saying those ones are gifted life in the kingdom of God. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has born out in my life.

Where I’m not trying to be the sole arbiter of my future, or the chief architect of my provision, or the infinite font of love for all the relationships in my life. When I’m able to recognize I have limitations and receive from God rather than perform for God, things go better. I can follow God’s outline for life today and trust the future to him. When I can believe in God’s care, I’m free to work as an outgrowth of creativity and service rather than as slave. I’m able to rest in God’s love for me and for others as the glue in relationship, when I can admit my shortcomings and give/receive forgiveness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Sunday we talked about a story where Simon walks away from this huge catch of fish Jesus gave him. In that story, and the ones immediately surrounding it, Jesus is demonstrating serious generosity. Healing folk, sharing wisdom, and providing this huge catch of fish all without asking for anything. It seems like he is walking around Capernaum and just providing for what folks need. Interestingly he doesn’t heal everyone, just the ones who come to him. He doesn’t provide fish for everybody, just Simon and his team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what it says about me, but sometimes when I read stories about healing in the Gospels I think about the folks who didn’t get healed. Maybe because I have prayed for healing with nothing happening at times. I have prayed for provision that doesn’t always materialize. Jesus is powerful and generous, also mysterious and cosmic. I don’t know his motivations or his timetables. Still it’s helpful for me to know that he heals, and sometimes he doesn’t; he provides in ways I’m looking for and expecting, and sometimes he doesn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a story that comes later where Jesus has taught some things that are downright confusing. Many of the folk who had been following him around, just left. They were no longer interested in a teacher who was so confusing and hard to pin down. At that point Jesus turns to Simon and the rest of disciples asking them ”are you all going to leave me too?” They respond by saying ”Lord who would we go to? You have the words of eternal life.” They were saying that Jesus is offering a unique type of healing and provision. They can’t get that anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realize that the healing Jesus doles out is more complete than any other and his provision is more secure, it’s easy to decide to follow him wherever. There are complexities. There are things I do not understand. But these do not overthrow the fundamental goodness, generosity, wisdom of the God found in Jesus of Nazareth. </p>",

In that story, and the ones immediately surrounding it, Jesus is demonstrating serious generosity. Healing folk, sharing wisdom, and providing this huge catch of fish all without asking for anything. It seems like he is walking around Capernaum and just providing for what folks need. Interestingly he doesn’t heal everyone, just the ones who come to him. He doesn’t provide fish for everybody, just Simon and his team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what it says about me, but sometimes when I read stories about healing in the Gospels I think about the folks who didn’t get healed. Maybe because I have prayed for healing with nothing happening at times. I have prayed for provision that doesn’t always materialize. Jesus is powerful and generous, also mysterious and cosmic. I don’t know his motivations or his timetables. Still it’s helpful for me to know that he heals, and sometimes he doesn’t; he provides in ways I’m looking for and expecting, and sometimes he doesn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a story that comes later where Jesus has taught some things that are downright confusing. Many of the folk who had been following him around, just left. They were no longer interested in a teacher who was so confusing and hard to pin down. At that point Jesus turns to Simon and the rest of disciples asking them ”are you all going to leave me too?” They respond by saying ”Lord who would we go to? You have the words of eternal life.” They were saying that Jesus is offering a unique type of healing and provision. They can’t get that anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realize that the healing Jesus doles out is more complete than any other and his provision is more secure, it’s easy to decide to follow him wherever. There are complexities. There are things I do not understand. But these do not overthrow the fundamental goodness, generosity, wisdom of the God found in Jesus of Nazareth. </p>"

But the story of Scripture shows us that Jesus lived as a person fully submitted to the Holy Spirit, not merely as the all-knowing God wearing human skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that as Jesus of Nazareth grew older, he learned things. Misunderstandings were corrected, new insight was acquired and he had perspectives that changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if Matthew caused some of Jesus’ ideas about what tax collectors were like to change. I wonder if the money lenders in the temple forced some of his notions about church to evolve. I wonder if the difficulty Peter had in sticking with his confession changed how Jesus thought about the nature of faith. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that, for me, evolving opinions is good. It’s a sign of growth. Even in places of faith. In the Church, we are proud inheritors of generations of learning and insights. Much has been thought through and experienced, and yet that inherited wisdom still needs to be applied to our contexts today. We build on the Faith of those who’ve gone before. We don’t throw it out. The cornerstone has been laid, the Creeds are secure, the Scriptures are settled, confession have been written. And yet, not every challenge has been faced and some questions have yet to surface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is real comfort for me in knowing that the God of our people has always been down in the reality of life with us. Not locked up dispassionate and separate from life’s complexity. It means God is not incapable of navigating competing truths and complex motivations. It moves me to more frequent prayers for wisdom. </p>",

But the story of Scripture shows us that Jesus lived as a person fully submitted to the Holy Spirit, not merely as the all-knowing God wearing human skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that as Jesus of Nazareth grew older, he learned things. Misunderstandings were corrected, new insight was acquired and he had perspectives that changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if Matthew caused some of Jesus’ ideas about what tax collectors were like to change. I wonder if the money lenders in the temple forced some of his notions about church to evolve. I wonder if the difficulty Peter had in sticking with his confession changed how Jesus thought about the nature of faith. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that, for me, evolving opinions is good. It’s a sign of growth. Even in places of faith. In the Church, we are proud inheritors of generations of learning and insights. Much has been thought through and experienced, and yet that inherited wisdom still needs to be applied to our contexts today. We build on the Faith of those who’ve gone before. We don’t throw it out. The cornerstone has been laid, the Creeds are secure, the Scriptures are settled, confession have been written. And yet, not every challenge has been faced and some questions have yet to surface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is real comfort for me in knowing that the God of our people has always been down in the reality of life with us. Not locked up dispassionate and separate from life’s complexity. It means God is not incapable of navigating competing truths and complex motivations. It moves me to more frequent prayers for wisdom. </p>"

I don’t think Jesus talks so much about money because he wants to give us tips on how to make our money work for us, or to conserve it or to spend it or to earn it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Jesus talks about money because he understands it as subversively sucking in all our faith. It’s very easy to have faith in money. It can protect us or provide for us, money can make us happy and help us make friends, money can bestow power and heal us, it can change living situation, the cars we drive the close we where the places we visit, the pictures we share, money can make us right…it can absolve us. Money is serious stuff. Quietly, subtly it can slide into all the places of faith. I think that’s why Jesus talks about it so much. Jesus would like to be the sole place of faith for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we can’t really avoid money. In fact money is not the problem. It’s the love of money that gets us…our faith in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this is not news to you. Just think of this as a friendly reminder to audit how you’re using money and what you’re hoping to get from it. Money is not a good god. Especially when you have Jesus as an option. </p>",

I don’t think Jesus talks so much about money because he wants to give us tips on how to make our money work for us, or to conserve it or to spend it or to earn it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Jesus talks about money because he understands it as subversively sucking in all our faith. It’s very easy to have faith in money. It can protect us or provide for us, money can make us happy and help us make friends, money can bestow power and heal us, it can change living situation, the cars we drive the close we where the places we visit, the pictures we share, money can make us right…it can absolve us. Money is serious stuff. Quietly, subtly it can slide into all the places of faith. I think that’s why Jesus talks about it so much. Jesus would like to be the sole place of faith for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we can’t really avoid money. In fact money is not the problem. It’s the love of money that gets us…our faith in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this is not news to you. Just think of this as a friendly reminder to audit how you’re using money and what you’re hoping to get from it. Money is not a good god. Especially when you have Jesus as an option. </p>"

It emerges from lots of work. The particular source of my pride yesterday came from the way the St. Augustine grass is spreading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago, in the mud and mess left behind from the new septic field,  we sodded sections of the yard. Since then, I’ve been following things I’ve learned the hard way: you have to cut St. Augustine high (roots can only grow as deep as the blades are tall. I learned that from the recluse neighbor who recently passed away), during the dry season pull weeds rather than merely mowing them down, trim taller trees to make sure the grass gets enough sun. All the work over the last several seasons has the grass looking good right now and I AM SATISFIED by it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Satisfaction at work well done is pretty great you all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder how Jesus felt when he described to the dudes on the road to Emmaus how all of the scriptures pointed to him and his finished work. There were lots of places along the way he could have quit or taken the easy way out…but no Jesus endured. I like to imagine that one of the emotions he felt was satisfaction at a job well done. </p>",

I can’t believe I’m about to say this…but I’m pretty proud of the grass in the back yard. It’s funny to be a guy who’s proud of his yard, but here I am. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I come by the pride naturally. It emerges from lots of work. The particular source of my pride yesterday came from the way the St. Augustine grass is spreading. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago, in the mud and mess left behind from the new septic field,  we sodded sections of the yard. Since then, I’ve been following things I’ve learned the hard way: you have to cut St. Augustine high (roots can only grow as deep as the blades are tall. I learned that from the recluse neighbor who recently passed away), during the dry season pull weeds rather than merely mowing them down, trim taller trees to make sure the grass gets enough sun. All the work over the last several seasons has the grass looking good right now and I AM SATISFIED by it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Satisfaction at work well done is pretty great you all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder how Jesus felt when he described to the dudes on the road to Emmaus how all of the scriptures pointed to him and his finished work. There were lots of places along the way he could have quit or taken the easy way out…but no Jesus endured. I like to imagine that one of the emotions he felt was satisfaction at a job well done. </p>"
