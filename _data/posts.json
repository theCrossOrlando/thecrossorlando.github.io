Go and let them know!&#8221;</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Whether you have a lot going on right now or very little, the same is true for you. The Christ has come with identity, purpose, love, forgiveness and eternity. This news is good for everyone.</div>"

I&#8217;m paying more attention to them than normal.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In times of transition or open questions, it can be even more remind yourself that the God can handle whatever comes. This psalm is that for me.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><i>Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth</i></p>\n<p><i>You have set your glory n the heavens.</i></p>\n<p><i>Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.</i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">When I consider your heavens,</span> the work of your fingers, <span style=\"font-size:medium;\">the moon and the stars,</span> which you have set in place, <span style=\"font-size:medium;\">what is mankind that you are mindful of them,</span> <span style=\"font-size:medium;\">human beings that you care for them?</span><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"> </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You have made them</span><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> a little lower than the angels</span> and crowned them with glory and honor.</i></p>\n<p><i>You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">feet: </span>all flocks and herds,<span style=\"font-family:monospace;\"> </span>and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!</i></p>\n</div>\n</div>"
