    "title": "The Four-Fold Benefit of POLIS",
    "description": "<p>The Polis Institute (POLIS) is an applied research non-profit that was founded to improve the way we help one another. Our mission is to champion human dignity by designing solutions to the social problems that infringe upon it. We envision a world in which most people enjoy the fruit of their labors in long and healthy lives.</p>\n<p>We focus on improving distressed neighborhoods because research points to this approach as the most strategic philanthropic investment. We facilitate partnerships with residents, investors, businesses, civic leaders, and non-profits to simultaneously address issues in education, housing, employment, health and wellness, overall aesthetics, and safety.</p>\n<p>To achieve success in this comprehensive approach, we deploy our Stakeholder Accountability Model that brings four key groups together to address these issues: 1) residents; 2) philanthropic investors; 3) service providers; 4) academics. The unique four-fold benefit of POLIS is that we simultaneously help each of these important groups.</p>\n<p>We work primarily in Metro Orlando. We have developed a Neighborhood Stress Index to monitor progress in the 100 most distressed areas of the region and have established a goal to propel this important city into the 90th percentile of American cities for well-being as measured by Gallup (currently in the 68th percentile) through neighborhood revitalization.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Residents</strong>: We work directly with residents of distressed neighborhoods to help them achieve their goals. Through margins in our consulting and training efforts, we can deploy 100% of your donations to serving this population in these three key areas:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">o <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Families</span>: The difficulties of raising a family are compounded by the stressors of poverty. We coordinate a program called MVP Families that serves 100 families who live near Camping World Stadium to strengthen relationships in the home, meet family goals, and help the children succeed academically.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">o <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Leaders</span>: Community leadership transcends the interests of any one organization or institution to benefit an entire community. We have developed training and coaching services to cultivate this talent in residents which has resulted in initiatives such as Leadership Eatonville, West Lakes Partnership, and the East Winter Garden Alliance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">o <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Underemployed</span>: Distressed neighborhoods are full of people whose talents are underappreciated. We engage residents in a four to six-month program to develop marketable skills while benefiting their community. To date, over 100 people have participated in this program, earning an average stipend of $2,700 while improving skills in computer literacy, communications, event planning, management, graphic design, meeting facilitation, data entry and analysis.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Philanthropic Investors</strong>: We improve the way philanthropic investment is deployed by providing consultation services and research to foundations, large non-profits, and local government. We work with some of the most influential groups in the city because their perspective, passion, and creativity is vital to solving our most complex issues. We currently work with Winter Park Health Foundation, Town of Eatonville, LIFT Orlando, City of Orlando, Florida Hospital, Florida Citrus Sports, Orlando Health, Haddock Family Foundation, and many others.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Service Providers</strong>: We improve the way that non-profits and other service providers serve their constituents through leadership coaching, volunteer training, and metrics. We also facilitate constructive partnerships to serve communities. Our primary volunteer training, Dignity Serves, has been used by hundreds of organizations to improve their service efforts. Our non-profit partners and clients include: First Presbyterian Church of Orlando, Hebni Nutrition, Jobs Partnership, Healthy Eatonville Place, St. Luke’s United Methodist Church, and Kaley Square.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Academics</strong>: We improve academic models through our applied research on theories of social change that originate in top-tier institutions such as Collective Impact (Harvard), Asset-Based Community Development (Northwestern), Human Centered Design (Stanford), Action Research (MIT), and Thriving Cities (University of Virginia). We facilitate the involvement of local academics from Rollins College, Valenica College, and University of Central Florida by helping place doctoral students in community settings and by collaborating with administration and faculty.</p>\n<p>Working with these four groups, POLIS has helped guide the Metro Orlando philanthropic community towards place and asset-based approaches to addressing concentrated poverty since its inception in 2009. This shift has resulted in tens of millions of dollars of investment in local neighborhoods, high levels of resident engagement and participation, and dramatic improvements in the lives of specific families and whole communities. Impacts include significant reductions in crime, improvements in educational outcomes, increases in affordable housing units, families exiting poverty, town charters modernized, reductions in chronic health problems, healthier infrastructure, career advancements, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Board of Directors</strong>:<br />\nDan Sherfield, Board Chair, Summit Church<br />\nScott Lee, Elevation Financial<br />\nJessica Jetton, Care for AIDS<br />\nJulie Zaiback, Adventist Health System<br />\nRyan Norman, Vistana Signature Experiences<br />\nAmanda Ward, Rollins College</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://polisinstitute.org/POLIS-2016-AR-Web.pdf\">read our annual report</a>, <a href=\"http://cffound.guidestar.org/NonprofitProfile.aspx?OrgId=1068077\">view our organizational profile at the Central Florida Foundation</a>, or contact us for more information.</p>\n\n<!-- WpssoSsbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

    "title": "Placemaking Through Artistic Expression",
    "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2006, I started an open mic in Orlando, FL called “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/81877492873/\">Diverse Word</a>.” I was a 23-year-old idealist who thought my city could use some diversity within the art of spoken word poetry. It became a success in terms of vision actualized, attendance, and the profit it brought to the local café that hosted it. I heard story after story of how meaningful this open mic was to patrons outside of the obvious enjoyment of free entertainment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the ten-year mark last year, I sought to document some of those stories and realized how important it was for forums like this to exist. I heard things like, “I was diagnosed with cancer and I came to the open mic to see how other people dealt with their issues. It was therapeutic for me and I have since been cancer-free.” I’m not saying that poetry cures cancer, but creating a safe space for expression does allow for the sacred spaces of human dreams and desires to be heard and tapped into. The positive outcomes from that expression were a byproduct of the original intent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something unique happens when people regularly gather together and express their dreams and desires. I noticed it at my open mic nights. And I learned it while <a href=\"http://polisinstitute.org/2016/11/resident-goals/\">working in communities</a> for Polis Institute. It led me to initiate an open mic arts night that includes music at Lake Lorna Doone Park. We are interested in seeing how this and other opportunities for community art and dialogue will transform this public city space and hopefully create a more welcoming environment for children and families. We’ve collaborated with <a href=\"http://artreachorlando.org/about\">ArtReach Orlando</a>, and on the Southwest corner of the park, under the broad shade of a tree, set up a blank canvas with paint. What effect will this have on the nearby schools and residents in 10 years?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/amanda_burden\">Amanda Burden</a> is a former NYC city commissioner who now consults globally to improve urban public spaces. She believes that cities must have enjoyable accessible public space to thrive, and has described them as “the glue that holds a city together, and…make[s] people want to live in a city and stay in a city.” In a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_burden_how_public_spaces_make_cities_work\">Ted Talk</a> on the subject, she summed up her philosophy with the thought that “a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the community of Orlando develops and strengthens all parts of our city, it seems to me that our direction should be to help people have a great time!

Intentional opportunities for artistic expression can invite in people that don’t always have a voice in the life of the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join us on any given Tuesday for the fabulous party of expression known as Diverse Word: from 4 to 6pm at Lake Lorna Doone Park and from 7:30 to 10pm at <a href=\"https://dandelioncommunitea.com/events/diverse-word/\">Dandelion Communitea Café</a>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more of Amanda Burden’s thoughts on public space, you can watch her 2014 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_burden_how_public_spaces_make_cities\">Ted talk</a> or read up on a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/01/08/462285380/how-can-public-spaces-change-a-citys-character\">2016 NPR interview</a>.</span></p>\n\n<!-- WpssoSsbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

It became a success in terms of vision actualized, attendance, and the profit it brought to the local café that hosted it. I heard story after story of how meaningful this open mic was to patrons outside of the obvious enjoyment of free entertainment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the ten-year mark last year, I sought to document some of those stories and realized how important it was for forums like this to exist. I heard things like, “I was diagnosed with cancer and I came to the open mic to see how other people dealt with their issues. It was therapeutic for me and I have since been cancer-free.” I’m not saying that poetry cures cancer, but creating a safe space for expression does allow for the sacred spaces of human dreams and desires to be heard and tapped into. The positive outcomes from that expression were a byproduct of the original intent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something unique happens when people regularly gather together and express their dreams and desires. I noticed it at my open mic nights. And I learned it while <a href=\"http://polisinstitute.org/2016/11/resident-goals/\">working in communities</a> for Polis Institute.

    "description": "<p>The Polis Institute is a non-profit organization that aims to remove the barriers that prevent experiencing long, healthy, fruitful and dignified lives. Many of these barriers stem from concentrated poverty, but there are additional barriers, both physical and metaphoric, that manifest in a variety of ways. We at POLIS use and develop research around the best practical ways to engage with people living in areas of high distress, and help design long-term solutions for the well-being of their community.</p>\n<p>Approaching global systemic issues very locally, over a long range of time, is not a popular model in our fast-paced, instant gratification society. But taking time to get to know people, and deeply considering their expressed desires and visions of what could be, can be effective on a grander scale than imagined.</p>\n<p>Conventionally, city sidewalks and city streets met at the right angle of a curb. No harm in that, right? You just step on and off. However, for Edward Roberts, confined to a wheelchair and iron lung after contracting polio, that six inch curb was a major hurdle. As a student at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, he became a disability rights activist, and led a movement to create curb cuts, or ramps, to allow sidewalk access to people with wheelchairs. Curb cuts had existed since the 1940s when they were created to assist disabled WWII vets, but were not in common use or well known until Roberts and his classmates worked to design solutions for a local, small, underserved group of people with limited mobility.</p>\n<p>With decades of effort, and the benefit of national attention to the accomplishments of this growing movement, the 1990 ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) was passed, mandating curb cuts everywhere &#8211; removing barriers to wheelchair access to city sidewalks and the cities themselves.</p>\n<p>My point, however is not that a small group won a victory that serves them alone. It is that a much larger and unanticipated group of people also benefitted from the well-designed solution of curb cuts. Anyone pushing a baby stroller or a grocery cart, riding a skateboard or bicycle, can use a curb cut. Curb cuts help call attention to an intersection’s crosswalk which increases pedestrian safety, are easier to shovel clear in the snow, and are more navigable for the very young and old. When people concentrate their efforts in assisting the overlooked, and solving just a single problem, it can open a whole new world of opportunities for all of society. The Polis Institute desires to be an Ed Roberts in the world, who in slowly serving and designing solutions for the one, would benefit the many in cities across the United States and the world.</p>\n\n<!-- WpssoSsbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

      "#": "<p>The Polis Institute is a non-profit organization that aims to remove the barriers that prevent experiencing long, healthy, fruitful and dignified lives. Many of these barriers stem from concentrated poverty, but there are additional barriers, both physical and metaphoric, that manifest in a variety of ways. We at POLIS use and develop research around the best practical ways to engage with people living in areas of high distress, and help design long-term solutions for the well-being of their community.</p>\n<p>Approaching global systemic issues very locally, over a long range of time, is not a popular model in our fast-paced, instant gratification society. But taking time to get to know people, and deeply considering their expressed desires and visions of what could be, can be effective on a grander scale than imagined.</p>\n<p>Conventionally, city sidewalks and city streets met at the right angle of a curb. No harm in that, right? You just step on and off. However, for Edward Roberts, confined to a wheelchair and iron lung after contracting polio, that six inch curb was a major hurdle. As a student at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, he became a disability rights activist, and led a movement to create curb cuts, or ramps, to allow sidewalk access to people with wheelchairs. Curb cuts had existed since the 1940s when they were created to assist disabled WWII vets, but were not in common use or well known until Roberts and his classmates worked to design solutions for a local, small, underserved group of people with limited mobility.</p>\n<p>With decades of effort, and the benefit of national attention to the accomplishments of this growing movement, the 1990 ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) was passed, mandating curb cuts everywhere &#8211; removing barriers to wheelchair access to city sidewalks and the cities themselves.</p>\n<p>My point, however is not that a small group won a victory that serves them alone. It is that a much larger and unanticipated group of people also benefitted from the well-designed solution of curb cuts. Anyone pushing a baby stroller or a grocery cart, riding a skateboard or bicycle, can use a curb cut. Curb cuts help call attention to an intersection’s crosswalk which increases pedestrian safety, are easier to shovel clear in the snow, and are more navigable for the very young and old. When people concentrate their efforts in assisting the overlooked, and solving just a single problem, it can open a whole new world of opportunities for all of society. The Polis Institute desires to be an Ed Roberts in the world, who in slowly serving and designing solutions for the one, would benefit the many in cities across the United States and the world.</p>\n\n<!-- WpssoSsbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->"

    "description": "<p>I know a guy named Stanley who needs a job. He&#8217;s in his forties and does not have a great resume or work ethic. He has some health problems. He seems to get hurt on the job a lot and has tried to sue more than one employer. He quit high school in the 10th grade but eventually earned a GED and joined the military. He characterizes his time in the military as the best time in his life. Since then, he has been out of work just as often as he has been employed. </p>\n<p>Stanley has tried out some job training programs but none have helped him get or keep a job. “There are just certain types of people we are not equipped to help,” said the director of one such program. I was a little surprised to hear him say that since I knew the program was started some years ago to help people exactly like Stanley. The director went on to explain how his organization had made a conscious decision to focus on people with fewer issues than Stanley seemed to have before adding, “and we have been expanding rapidly ever since.”</p>\n<p>I have heard explanations like this before. A non-profit starts out trying to reach the most hurting and marginalized in our midst but as the frustrations of dealing with the harder cases collide with the desire to grow the organization, they raise the bar on who they are willing to help. In some ways, it makes sense. Why spend 90% of your effort to help 50% of your clients achieve 10% of the desired outcomes? Focus on those who are ready and equipped to move forward and you will see the fruit of your hard work pay off more quickly while watching your programs grow and funding increase. Seems like a rational choice.</p>\n<p>But what about Stanley?</p>\n<p>There is a big difference between helping people get a job and helping a particular person get a job. When you help people get a job, you weed out the Stanleys until you find someone easier to work with. But when you try to help Stanley get a job, everything changes because he continues to matter to you whether he gets a job or not. If Stanley is more to you than a client – if he’s a friend, a family member, or a neighbor – you continue to invite him to social gatherings while he’s looking for work and after he gets fired from another job. You celebrate successes with him and empathize with his frustrations. You share your story with him and listen to his story. You laugh with him and cry with him. If Stanley is just a client, your relationship with him ends when his progress in your program ends.</p>\n<p>We all need more friends in our life than we need program directors. We need more neighbors than case workers. And we need more family than we need professional care givers. That doesn’t mean that we never need professionals in our life or that it is somehow wrong to secure their help. What we all need is someone who will love us and encourage us even when we don’t make the best choices. It’s just harder for professionals to continue to be that loving person when we don’t get with the program or make our payments.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood focused, place-based work ascribes higher value to neighborly kindness and familial care than professional help because it is more in line with our long-term interests and basic needs. There is certainly room for professionals to help but that help should be temporary and leveraged in ways that clearly support one’s long-term interests. It also means that one should expect limits to what professionals will be willing to endure.</p>\n<p>I’ve known Stanley for a few years now. He needs a job. Although his wife is working, they are not quite making it and they may have to move out of the neighborhood they love so much. Their neighbors love them too. He and his wife regularly help their elderly neighbors with shopping and yard work. They participate in community meetings and helped start a community garden and newsletter. If they moved, it would really be a loss for the community. </p>\n<p>Stanley also really wants to work. He says he feels better about himself when he’s doing something productive and actively contributing to the family’s finances. He hasn’t done well in the manual labor jobs that he typically gets and thinks if he tries another route things will improve. His self-confidence is really low and he’s not convinced that he can do other, non-labor-intensive jobs but he is willing to try. In sum, he could use professional help to learn some new skills and he might benefit from some professional counseling as well. But Stanley, like all of us, is most in need of unconditional love and support that only family, friends, and neighbors provide. </p>\n<p>POLIS began piloting a program called Job Support Services earlier this year to help Stanley and 190 other people in his community who are out of work but looking for a job. The program helps residents apply to one of six employer partners who have agreed to give hiring priority to participants. Employers are willing to do that because we have assembled a team of volunteer residents and supportive partners who will help these applicants become great employees – child care, transportation, and encouragement will be provided.</p>\n<p>We have also partnered with larger training and job support programs like the one mentioned at the beginning of this article. They can still focus on specialized services that help people get jobs – resume writing, job interviewing skills, technical skills – while the resident volunteers provide the type of emotional and tactical support that will eventually help Stanley secure and keep a job. POLIS is providing professional design and support services during the pilot phase. When this phase concludes, our support will transition toward a resident-run program that helps ensure that everyone in the community that wants a job, has a job, and that when particular people like Stanley lose jobs or struggle to find work, friends and neighbors will be there to offer encouragement and connections.</p>\n\n<!-- WpssoSsbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

Life moves. Things go well and things go poorly, but either way they go. Forward. Today becomes yesterday, and yesterday fades. People get older, and so do I. It&#8217;s not earth shattering, but it hit me again this weekend. I think that&#8217;s startling every once in a while because time feels limited. Like stories are running past me and I can&#8217;t hold on to them.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what makes Jesus in the desert so hopeful. He looked squarely at the opportunity to trade the promise of long term fulfillment for immediate satisfaction, and didn&#8217;t. He was not afraid that he&#8217;d run out of time; that this world was all he had; that the realities of earth limited the potential of his future. Presented with the option to trade eternity for now, he turned it down. I wonder what I&#8217;d do. It&#8217;s to hard to trust that the God has food for me, I&#8217;ll take it my way. It&#8217;s too hard to trust the God has provision for me, I&#8217;ll scheme for it. It&#8217;s too hard to trust he knows and loves me, I&#8217;ll do anything to feel like people love me.</p>\n<p>Jesus knew. He believed and made the choice. There is a pay off in that story for faith in Jesus. His choice, empowers ours. In my life so far I&#8217;ve seen God come through; I&#8217;ve discovered his wisdom as deeper than mine. Somehow Jesus&#8217; ability to believe is mystically connected to mine. I know connection with God because Jesus did, I experience faith because he did. I can believe that the time I&#8217;m given is not limited to this world and make choices consistent with that belief, because he did.</p>",

Things go well and things go poorly, but either way they go. Forward. Today becomes yesterday, and yesterday fades. People get older, and so do I. It&#8217;s not earth shattering, but it hit me again this weekend. I think that&#8217;s startling every once in a while because time feels limited. Like stories are running past me and I can&#8217;t hold on to them.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what makes Jesus in the desert so hopeful. He looked squarely at the opportunity to trade the promise of long term fulfillment for immediate satisfaction, and didn&#8217;t. He was not afraid that he&#8217;d run out of time; that this world was all he had; that the realities of earth limited the potential of his future. Presented with the option to trade eternity for now, he turned it down. I wonder what I&#8217;d do. It&#8217;s to hard to trust that the God has food for me, I&#8217;ll take it my way. It&#8217;s too hard to trust the God has provision for me, I&#8217;ll scheme for it. It&#8217;s too hard to trust he knows and loves me, I&#8217;ll do anything to feel like people love me.</p>\n<p>Jesus knew. He believed and made the choice. There is a pay off in that story for faith in Jesus. His choice, empowers ours. In my life so far I&#8217;ve seen God come through; I&#8217;ve discovered his wisdom as deeper than mine. Somehow Jesus&#8217; ability to believe is mystically connected to mine. I know connection with God because Jesus did, I experience faith because he did. I can believe that the time I&#8217;m given is not limited to this world and make choices consistent with that belief, because he did.</p>"

For those of us who practice Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD), this is a fundamental part of the work &#8211; helping residents of a small geographic area leverage their skills and networks to realize their dreams. Connecting the dreams of particular residents to one another and those shared dreams to the overall transformation of a community is where the work gets exciting.</p>\n<p>As straightforward as this sounds, this type of emphasis is quite rare. There are a few reasons for this, most of which are not bad. First, funding sources for programs tend to want to know what you plan to do before they give you the money. Makes sense. But then, that&#8217;s what you have to do. And if your grant was written to improve health outcomes in a community whose stated priority is jobs, then you have a conflict on your hands. The solution to this is to simply include a discovery phase for grants and to allow some ability to adjust to what is discovered.</p>\n<p>Similarly, non-profits tend to get started to address a single, specific issue like homelessness, employability, school grades, or blindness to name a few. They then scale their work as they successfully help their clients address the issue. When the potential client-base is a city of over 200,000 people or a county of over a million people, a non-profit can continue its march towards excellence and success because it can and will focus its attention on those clients most amenable to what they have to offer. When the client-base is the residents of a particular neighborhood of 1,500 people, everything changes. And the business model of most non-profits simply will not survive that scale.</p>\n<p>The solution to this is quite simple. Simply create a program whose sole purpose is to help the neighborhood residents establish and meet their goals while bringing in specialist partners who can help the residents succeed in particular areas. The biggest challenge to this is establishing sufficient trust to allow people to share their goals in the first place. Asking people what they are hoping to achieve in life is way more personal that asking them to show up to a cooking class.

It's easy during this busy season to forget to be excited about your clients and the people you are working with. This is the scrambling season...the one that sustains a catering company during the slow summer months. You'll see a lot of caterers over-booking, under-staffing, or biting off more than they can chew. Pay attention to the person who is trying to get your business. Do they seem interested in your vision? Do they get excited about the possibilities for the menu? Or are they just taking your order?</div><div>Make sure you're getting quality! Before I was in this business, I was a customer. I was part of the decision-making team for quite a few events, and booked several caterers. One in particular I remember I was so excited about the menu. I'd already started to get into cooking a little, and the menu this company prepared looked amazing! The price was pretty reasonable, so I recommended we book them. The event came, and I sat down to dinner, and this beautiful menu I'd approved with my coworkers was in front of me...and half of it was from a can! I was so disappointed. All of the amazing ingredients you can get fresh in Florida, and you choose to open a can and call it a day. Canned goods are a great cost-saving product, but you have to know when to use them. Replacing fresh vegetables with canned is just not something I like to do. Even if it changes my bottom line a little, I'm going to ditch the can and keep your plate looking bright and clean. And if I can, I'm going to get local ingredients as much as possible.</div><div><div>Ask what the caterer provides before you book.</div> Some caterers will charge extra for certain things, like linens, platters, and other re-usable items. That's industry standard...just make sure you see what is included in the price before hand. You don't want to get stuck with line-item charges that can increase your final bill. If a caterer includes these items...even better! Is the caterer charging you for meetings at the event venue? Are there any tastings included with your package? Generally, I'll do tastings for weddings or new clients at cost or free of charge for up to four people, depending on the circumstances. Keep in mind, a tasting is not a full meal...it's just a sneak peek of what the caterer can do. </div><div>I hope you enjoy this Holiday Season. Give me a call if you'd like me to put together a menu for your event, or share with you my list of favorite Central Florida venues. </div></div>",

    "description": "<div><div>My husband and I had a great day yesterday. He's a surfer so we got up early and spent a few hours at New Smyrna Beach in the morning. I wasn't quite ready to go back to Orlando and give up on the beautiful day yet, so I suggested we drive north to St. Augustine to see how they were faring a few weeks after Hurricane Matthew. </div><div>Other than some lingering debris and a few waterfront hotels and homes still boarded up, on the surface everything looked great. I guess you don't get to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida\">America's Oldest City</a> by being weak and slow to rebound. Anyway, we've been to St. Augustine a couple of times, and took a stroll down St. George Street to take everything in. Kids in Halloween costumes were running up and down the pedestrian street, having a great time. We decided to stop into an old favorite, The Columbia, for an early dinner. I'm more of a fan of finding new places to eat, but Don loves the Columbia, and I couldn't say no to him. Plus I was STARVING. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_2c538cd432ea41bb99b09f1bcf881b99~mv2.jpg\"/><div>So we sat down in the familiar restaurant and I ordered a Sangria (I wasn't the one who was going to drive the 2 hours back home). We like our quiet, Sunday Fundays. So different from how we chose to spend Sundays a few years ago, now we enjoy one or two quality drinks, a great meal, and chat about the week ahead. I like growing up. I took my first sip of Sangria as soon as the waiter set it in front of me, and it was pretty good. Brandy...good. Red Wine, probably Spanish...good. Fruit...good. Then I noticed a little box next to the salt &amp; pepper shakers. SANGRIA MIX. What?!?! I go to this amazing restaurant and they try to sell you a MIX for the Sangria? What could there possibly be for you to mix that you could get in a box? Oh, silly me...of course the main ingredients of any good sangria are dehydrated fruit mix, sugar, dextrin, tricalcium phosphate, fractionated coconut oil (what is that?), egg whites, red 40, blue 1, yellow 5 and yellow 6. Are you kidding me? No. Just no. Even the most recipe-challenged person can figure out how to make a tasty beverage without a bunch of weird dehydrated crap. </div><div>Here's my recipe...it makes a lot. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_9f1052a1b04149a6a745be2833050f08~mv2_d_1800_3200_s_2.jpg\"/><div>1 box red wine...yes, I said BOX. You can also use a JUG if you want to get swanky. Why do I use cheap wine? Because I'm adding brandy, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm not going to notice quality wine, and frankly, I'd be wasting a good bottle. Feel free to find a cheap ORGANIC bottle or box if you must. </div><div>1 cup brandy</div><div>Club Soda</div><div>3 oranges, sliced</div><div>1 fuji apple</div><div>1 sliced peach or nectarine</div><div>1 cup pitted and smushed cherries</div><div>1 sliced lime</div><div>1 sliced lemon</div><div>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</div><div>1/4 teaspoon cardamom</div><div>Warm the brandy a bit on the stove and mix in the cinnamon and cardamom so they dissolve better. You CAN add sugar if you want at this step, but it's not something I'm a fan of. If you need more sweet to this sangria, add some raw organic honey at this step. </div><div>Mix the Brandy with the red wine. Squeeze the oranges a bit and drop them in the mix along with the rest of the fruit. Stir well and let sit at least a couple hours...overnight is better. Splash in a bit of club soda just before you serve. You can also use ginger ale or Sprite, but I'm trying to keep some chemicals out. </div><div>Enjoy this for your next grown-up Sangria Sunday. It will make Monday feel that much further away. </div></div>",

      "#": "<div><div>My husband and I had a great day yesterday. He's a surfer so we got up early and spent a few hours at New Smyrna Beach in the morning. I wasn't quite ready to go back to Orlando and give up on the beautiful day yet, so I suggested we drive north to St. Augustine to see how they were faring a few weeks after Hurricane Matthew. </div><div>Other than some lingering debris and a few waterfront hotels and homes still boarded up, on the surface everything looked great. I guess you don't get to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida\">America's Oldest City</a> by being weak and slow to rebound. Anyway, we've been to St. Augustine a couple of times, and took a stroll down St. George Street to take everything in. Kids in Halloween costumes were running up and down the pedestrian street, having a great time. We decided to stop into an old favorite, The Columbia, for an early dinner. I'm more of a fan of finding new places to eat, but Don loves the Columbia, and I couldn't say no to him. Plus I was STARVING. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_2c538cd432ea41bb99b09f1bcf881b99~mv2.jpg\"/><div>So we sat down in the familiar restaurant and I ordered a Sangria (I wasn't the one who was going to drive the 2 hours back home). We like our quiet, Sunday Fundays. So different from how we chose to spend Sundays a few years ago, now we enjoy one or two quality drinks, a great meal, and chat about the week ahead. I like growing up. I took my first sip of Sangria as soon as the waiter set it in front of me, and it was pretty good. Brandy...good. Red Wine, probably Spanish...good. Fruit...good. Then I noticed a little box next to the salt &amp; pepper shakers. SANGRIA MIX. What?!?! I go to this amazing restaurant and they try to sell you a MIX for the Sangria? What could there possibly be for you to mix that you could get in a box? Oh, silly me...of course the main ingredients of any good sangria are dehydrated fruit mix, sugar, dextrin, tricalcium phosphate, fractionated coconut oil (what is that?), egg whites, red 40, blue 1, yellow 5 and yellow 6. Are you kidding me? No. Just no. Even the most recipe-challenged person can figure out how to make a tasty beverage without a bunch of weird dehydrated crap. </div><div>Here's my recipe...it makes a lot. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_9f1052a1b04149a6a745be2833050f08~mv2_d_1800_3200_s_2.jpg\"/><div>1 box red wine...yes, I said BOX. You can also use a JUG if you want to get swanky. Why do I use cheap wine? Because I'm adding brandy, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm not going to notice quality wine, and frankly, I'd be wasting a good bottle. Feel free to find a cheap ORGANIC bottle or box if you must. </div><div>1 cup brandy</div><div>Club Soda</div><div>3 oranges, sliced</div><div>1 fuji apple</div><div>1 sliced peach or nectarine</div><div>1 cup pitted and smushed cherries</div><div>1 sliced lime</div><div>1 sliced lemon</div><div>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</div><div>1/4 teaspoon cardamom</div><div>Warm the brandy a bit on the stove and mix in the cinnamon and cardamom so they dissolve better. You CAN add sugar if you want at this step, but it's not something I'm a fan of. If you need more sweet to this sangria, add some raw organic honey at this step. </div><div>Mix the Brandy with the red wine. Squeeze the oranges a bit and drop them in the mix along with the rest of the fruit. Stir well and let sit at least a couple hours...overnight is better. Splash in a bit of club soda just before you serve. You can also use ginger ale or Sprite, but I'm trying to keep some chemicals out. </div><div>Enjoy this for your next grown-up Sangria Sunday. It will make Monday feel that much further away. </div></div>"

Where does his movement break out these days?</p>\n<p>I was reminded in conversation with a friend the other day that I want the way of Jesus to be the defining narrative of my life. More than my natural political leanings, or theological upbringing, or even the narrative of my childhood. These mindsets can blind us to Jesus in our midst, they did for folks in his day. I want the reality of his resurrection and authority to be the driving truth for who I am in the world: my opinions and actions.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m working to give myself some space this week to consider where Jesus would be found these days so that I can begin to imagine how I might be found there as well.</p>"

Hanging on the outcome of that decision is the manner of his death, the scope of his life and the future of mortality.

I understand what he meant. There is so much possibility there. The road away from that stone can go almost anywhere. Christ, walking around in the world with a glorified body means we&#8217;re no longer bound to our basest instincts. God can raise us to the heights of our best desires. We have a future somewhere out ahead of us that is unambiguously good.</p>\n<p>But if I had to isolate the most powerful point in Christianity&#8217;s story, I would pick a different spot: the Garden of Gethsemane on the night Christ was betrayed. It feels like the fulcrum on which the future of humanity is leveraged. In that moment Christ decides not only his next course of action but the depth of his confidence in the goodness of God. Hanging on the outcome of that decision is the manner of his death, the scope of his life and the future of mortality. It turns out the faith of Christ is deep enough to swallow humiliation, injustice and death. As he kneels, alone in the garden that overlooks the ancient City of God, that point is decided.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow is Good Friday. I love that day. Not because Christ died. I love that he chose death. I love that confidence in the goodness of God drove him to believe God&#8217;s promise more than the visceral reality that confronted him.</p>\n<p>His belief opens the door for me to believe. On Good Friday, he throws the door wide open.</p>"

I like that.</p>\n<p>I can think of lot&#8217;s of places I&#8217;d like to go with the people I love: high snowy mountains, secluded ravines, beautiful beaches or ancient churches. But as I walk through those questions, I always see myself coming back.</p>\n<p>There are friends and acquaintances here that wouldn&#8217;t make my travel list, but I&#8217;d still miss. I like the idea that I&#8217;m working with people all over Orlando to build something. On the kickball fields of the Jackson Center to the upstairs offices of the East End Market, from the West lake community meetings to the tech association meet ups to the office spaces above Park Avenue friends are doing their part. Cities are not living really, but sort of. They grow and mature, they develop personality and character. Cities have major arteries with hearts that distribute power and people and culture as lifeblood. They are the creation of people: designed and built, welded and paved, planted and uprooted, planned and governed, raised and released. It takes all sorts of people to make a great city, but they are the product of people. Through and through. I like that.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to the Great Creator, we create.</p>\n<p>Orlando is a great city for many reasons, but one is: there&#8217;s room for you. Don&#8217;t let fear of insignificance, or apathy for the future, or a myopic focus on it&#8217;s shortcomings keep you from the thrill of joining the collaborative effort. Contribute. The Cross is a good place to start. Many of us are already entrenched. We&#8217;ve built the alliances and are hard at work. Creation is best done with friends.</p>",

I like that.</p>\n<p>I can think of lot&#8217;s of places I&#8217;d like to go with the people I love: high snowy mountains, secluded ravines, beautiful beaches or ancient churches. But as I walk through those questions, I always see myself coming back.</p>\n<p>There are friends and acquaintances here that wouldn&#8217;t make my travel list, but I&#8217;d still miss. I like the idea that I&#8217;m working with people all over Orlando to build something. On the kickball fields of the Jackson Center to the upstairs offices of the East End Market, from the West lake community meetings to the tech association meet ups to the office spaces above Park Avenue friends are doing their part. Cities are not living really, but sort of. They grow and mature, they develop personality and character. Cities have major arteries with hearts that distribute power and people and culture as lifeblood. They are the creation of people: designed and built, welded and paved, planted and uprooted, planned and governed, raised and released. It takes all sorts of people to make a great city, but they are the product of people. Through and through. I like that.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to the Great Creator, we create.</p>\n<p>Orlando is a great city for many reasons, but one is: there&#8217;s room for you. Don&#8217;t let fear of insignificance, or apathy for the future, or a myopic focus on it&#8217;s shortcomings keep you from the thrill of joining the collaborative effort. Contribute. The Cross is a good place to start. Many of us are already entrenched. We&#8217;ve built the alliances and are hard at work. Creation is best done with friends.</p>"
