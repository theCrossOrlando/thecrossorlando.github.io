    "description": "<p>Megan and I got really sucked into the TV show Lost, when it first aired. We watched the first season on DVD, but then anxiously waited for each new episode to air and gathered with some friends to watch it. That feeling of really wanting to know how things would end is so unique. I didn’t want be in charge of the ending and I was enjoying the show so much I didn’t really want it to end. Yet, the plot was so compelling I was always looking forward to how it would unfold. It’s kind of like watching a good baseball game. You’re watching it because there will be an end, but totally enjoying the progress to the end without knowing the path to get there. In some cases, being out of control is really great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a new puppy in the house. He’s fantastic. But for an hour or two a day he gets super hyper. In that mode he’s very unpredictable. There can be barking, even some sharp puppy teeth chomping at anything in their vicinity. He’s got his own mind, and is not under control. It can get unnerving. Things will settle down, at some point. However, no one really enjoys the journey to the resolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past Sunday we said that something like 3/4’s of the Christian faith is accepting: there is a God and it’s not me. In moments of faith I am able to experience the lack of control in my life more like one of the first scenarios. I’m actively engaged, but not controlling life’s unfolding resolution. I am not responsible for all the outcomes or the myriad of future possibilities. Other times, it feels like everything is out of control and some one is moving pieces that I wish they wouldn’t. I don’t know how or why things are happening and I’m nervous that whoever is in control cannot be trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I know that God is never a hyper puppy. At times it can be hard to believe. Today, I’m asking for peace to rest in the reality that God is good, and stands in solidarity with me at God’s own expense.  </p>",

I forgot how fun it was, I also forgot how sweaty it was. I’m not sure how your days go, but it’s easier for me to focus when I intersperse mental breaks. The bike is an amazing mental break. It requires focus to pick the route, avoid people and cars and not wreck.  It involves just enough exertion to be engage my body and get the blood flowing. When I don’t have a bike, a walk will do; but it’s not quite as good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found this is true in prayer life as well. Sometimes I need to change my approach to prayer and try new practices. Switch from journaling to walking prayer; or from Lectio divinia to the breath prayer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting directly to God through Jesus is a beautiful reality this side of Pentecost. And yet, it is quiet and often solitary. It takes a degree of focus, patience, and presence that is not always natural and often easy to skip over. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a brief reminder that it’s worth the effort to find your way to prayer. </p>"

That came up because we were mentioning the Sermon on the Mount. I don’t know that I’ve ever phrased it exactly like that before, but the understanding comes from a professor I had in Seminary: Prof. Jeffery Gibbs. He understood the beatitudes as nine descriptors of followers of Jesus. We all mourn, are meek and want to be righteous. We all are merciful, pure in heart and are peacemakers. Of course not perfectly or all the time. Professor Gibbs said this is why “Blessed are the poor in sprint for theirs is the kingdom of God,” came first. That affirmation points to the reality that, with respect to spiritual things, we are all poor. We can not will ourselves to be merciful or pure of Heart or peacemakers perfectly, all the time. We don’t have the resources to manage appropriate meekness in every situation we can’t always conjure a desire for righteousness. If we’re going to approach living like followers of Jesus, we’re going to have to recognize our limitations. Jesus is saying those ones are gifted life in the kingdom of God. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has born out in my life. I experience the fruit of the Spirit much more readily in seasons where I’m aquatinted with my limitations. Where I’m not trying to be the sole arbiter of my future, or the chief architect of my provision, or the infinite font of love for all the relationships in my life. When I’m able to recognize I have limitations and receive from God rather than perform for God, things go better. I can follow God’s outline for life today and trust the future to him. When I can believe in God’s care, I’m free to work as an outgrowth of creativity and service rather than as slave. I’m able to rest in God’s love for me and for others as the glue in relationship, when I can admit my shortcomings and give/receive forgiveness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Sunday we talked about a story where Simon walks away from this huge catch of fish Jesus gave him. In that story, and the ones immediately surrounding it, Jesus is demonstrating serious generosity. Healing folk, sharing wisdom, and providing this huge catch of fish all without asking for anything. It seems like he is walking around Capernaum and just providing for what folks need. Interestingly he doesn’t heal everyone, just the ones who come to him. He doesn’t provide fish for everybody, just Simon and his team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what it says about me, but sometimes when I read stories about healing in the Gospels I think about the folks who didn’t get healed. Maybe because I have prayed for healing with nothing happening at times. I have prayed for provision that doesn’t always materialize. Jesus is powerful and generous, also mysterious and cosmic. I don’t know his motivations or his timetables. Still it’s helpful for me to know that he heals, and sometimes he doesn’t; he provides in ways I’m looking for and expecting, and sometimes he doesn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a story that comes later where Jesus has taught some things that are downright confusing. Many of the folk who had been following him around, just left. They were no longer interested in a teacher who was so confusing and hard to pin down. At that point Jesus turns to Simon and the rest of disciples asking them ”are you all going to leave me too?” They respond by saying ”Lord who would we go to? You have the words of eternal life.” They were saying that Jesus is offering a unique type of healing and provision. They can’t get that anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realize that the healing Jesus doles out is more complete than any other and his provision is more secure, it’s easy to decide to follow him wherever. There are complexities. There are things I do not understand. But these do not overthrow the fundamental goodness, generosity, wisdom of the God found in Jesus of Nazareth. </p>",

In that story, and the ones immediately surrounding it, Jesus is demonstrating serious generosity. Healing folk, sharing wisdom, and providing this huge catch of fish all without asking for anything. It seems like he is walking around Capernaum and just providing for what folks need. Interestingly he doesn’t heal everyone, just the ones who come to him. He doesn’t provide fish for everybody, just Simon and his team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what it says about me, but sometimes when I read stories about healing in the Gospels I think about the folks who didn’t get healed. Maybe because I have prayed for healing with nothing happening at times. I have prayed for provision that doesn’t always materialize. Jesus is powerful and generous, also mysterious and cosmic. I don’t know his motivations or his timetables. Still it’s helpful for me to know that he heals, and sometimes he doesn’t; he provides in ways I’m looking for and expecting, and sometimes he doesn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a story that comes later where Jesus has taught some things that are downright confusing. Many of the folk who had been following him around, just left. They were no longer interested in a teacher who was so confusing and hard to pin down. At that point Jesus turns to Simon and the rest of disciples asking them ”are you all going to leave me too?” They respond by saying ”Lord who would we go to? You have the words of eternal life.” They were saying that Jesus is offering a unique type of healing and provision. They can’t get that anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realize that the healing Jesus doles out is more complete than any other and his provision is more secure, it’s easy to decide to follow him wherever. There are complexities. There are things I do not understand. But these do not overthrow the fundamental goodness, generosity, wisdom of the God found in Jesus of Nazareth. </p>"
