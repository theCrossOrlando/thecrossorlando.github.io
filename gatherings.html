  body: We’re gathering for Ash Wednesday this week. It starts the season of Lent,
    a time of reflection on our need for new beginnings. Join us at 1010@at 6p on
    March 6th.
- title: Sundays
  image: assets/sundays.jpg
  body: We gather weekly on Sunday mornings around 10a. Our people, the people of
    God, have been gathering regularly for millenia. The goal has always been to retell
    the story of God and remember that we're his, to share the peace of God, and to
    encourage one another through the good and bad of life. So those are our goals
    too. If you join us,  you can expect a heartfelt retelling of the story, space
    to worship the God and we usually have lunch together.
- title: Kids

  body: We want our kids to learn what it means that they belong to the God who made
    them and saved them. We have three groups of volunteers who work through curriculum
    towards that end. The groups are divided by age.  The oldest kids (Kindergarten
    through fifth grade), Preschoolers and toddlers.  Our mornings consist of building
    community through faith and story.  The goal of our time on Sundays is to learn
    to live together with the story of Scripture as our main conversation.  Its a
    gathering with the biggest focus of building a foundation of faith for our next
    generation of believers.
- title: Neighborhood Dinners

  body: "When church is at it’s best, it becomes like a second family. We may not
    agree on everything, but we’re committed to love one another and can count on
    each other to stand with us through good and bad. For many of us the Cross has
    become like that, the regular “Neighborhood Dinners” are like an extended family
    meal. It’s an informal potluck where we hear each other’s stories and catch up
    on any church business. Contact Ben or Carole to figure out how you can get connected
    to your neighborhood dinner. \n"
- title: Know Our Neighborhood

  body: "Most of the time, the best we have to offer anyone else is genuine friendship.
    That can be hard across cultural or societal barriers. But hard does not equal
    impossible. We are motivated by the conviction that a life like Jesus' leads to
