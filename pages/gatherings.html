  body: "We gather weekly on Sunday mornings around 10a. Our people, the people of
    God, have been gathering regularly for millenia. The goal has always been to retell
    the story of God and remember that we're his, to share the peace of God, and to
    encourage one another through the good and bad of life. So those are our goals
    too. If you join us,  you can expect a heartfelt retelling of the story, space
    to worship the God and we usually have lunch together.\n\n"
- title: Kids

  body: We want our kids to learn what it means that they belong to the God who made
    them and saved them. We have three groups of volunteers who work through curriculum
    towards that end. The groups are divided by age.  The oldest kids (Kindergarten
    through fifth grade), Preschoolers and toddlers.  Our mornings consist of building
    community through faith and story.  The goal of our time on Sundays is to learn
    to live together with the story of Scripture as our main conversation.  Its a
    gathering with the biggest focus of building a foundation of faith for our next
    generation of believers.
- title: Neighborhood Dinners

  body: "When church is at its best, it becomes like a second family. We may not agree
    on everything, but we’re committed to love one another and can count on each other
    to stand with us through good and bad. For many of us the Cross has become like
    that, the regular “Neighborhood Dinners” are like an extended family meal. It’s
    an informal potluck where we hear each other’s stories and catch up on any church
    business. Contact Ben or Carole to figure out how you can get connected to your
    neighborhood dinner. \n\nNext Events:\n\nStay tuned for more neighborhood dinners!"
