  body: I grew up in the church, was baptized as a baby and have been learning to
    live with the Lord ever since. I met and married Megan while attending University
    of Florida. Together we moved to St. Louis while I attended Concorida seminary.
    We now have three beautiful kids and live in the SoDo area. We founded The Cross
    Orlando with a few friends in the fall of 2010. For us it's been a lesson in the
    generosity of God, the fact that he's drawn such a unique group of people together
    into a congregation that fits us so well feels like an extreme demonstration of
    his kindness. I'm proud to pastor such a great family and always hope to be able
    to authentically say, with St.Paul, follow me as I follow Christ.

  info: Carole cares for our kids and some of our operational details.

  body: Growing up with a sweet relationship with the Lord, I don't remember a time
    without Him.  My family is full of generations of faithfulness and I'm proud to
    carry that legacy into my own family.  In 2004 I graduated from Bethany College
    of Missions in Minneapolis to pursue a career in ministry.  Since then, the Lord
    brought me a North Carolina native husband Mike and two kids, Moses and Elie.  Our
    family has taken a fabulous journey from a home in Raleigh, North Carolina to
    three years in Minnesota for Mike to finish his degree in Graphic Design and then
    finally to a wonderful home here in Orlando.  We love our community at The Cross
    and enjoy watching our kids participate in a place that loves and cares for them.  I
    find joy in teaching the children what it looks like to have faith in a God that
    we cannot see and to pass the stories of our people from Scripture on to them
    is something that can never be replaced.  I am excited to see how their lives
    unfold with this sweet relationship that I see growing inside each of them.

  body: I grew up on the gulf coast of Florida and went to University of Florida where
    I met my wife Michelle.  We were married in 2002 and have been in Orlando ever
    since.  Together we have a small counseling practice in downtown.  Having grown
    up in the church, Jesus has been a central piece of my life for almost all I can
    remember.  Faith and life have not always been easy roads in many ways, but I
    believe Jesus is the source of  hope and life we were made for.  We came to The
    Cross in 2013, and have found ourselves in deep friendships here, hoping to keep
    finding Jesus alongside folks who are doing the same.

  body: I have known about the Lord for as long as my memories go back. God has
    been a staple of hope and restoration time and again in my life and I’ve
    seen those traits play out in people in all walks of life. I moved from
    South Carolina to Florida in 2003, and my husband Kirk and I started coming
    to the Cross in 2010. We have seen the Lord work through the people of the
    Cross to make Orlando a place where Jesus is the foundation of homes,
    businesses, and everyday life and we are so thankful to be apart of this
    family.

  body: I was born and raised in the Orlando area and have enjoyed watching its
    culture blossom over the years. I met my husband here, and we live north of
    the city with our two kids. The traditions of the Church have always been a
    part of my life, but it wasn't until adulthood that I started to understand
    my own relationship with God. After attending The Cross and engaging with
    people who are quietly doing God's work in this community, I began to see
    the person of Jesus and his teachings differently, which renewed my faith in
    His love. I’ve enjoyed building friendships with other families, and I'm
    grateful for the authenticity and kindness found among this unique
    congregation.

  body: I grew up in Orlando and in a local church community that my family attended.
    After college and meeting my husband, we eventually found our home at The Cross
    Orlando in 2013 where we have encountered sweet relationships and people who love
    the Lord and love to do His work. We feel blessed to be able to raise our children
    with these friends and are grateful to be a part of this group that is making a real
    impact.
