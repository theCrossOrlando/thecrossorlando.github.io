- title: Terry
  info: Terry is deeply connected among artists and arts organizations in town. Want
    to find places to connect to the arts? Reach out to him.
  body: My parents moved to several different communities when I was growing up and
    along the way we found personal relationships with Jesus.  I’ve been blessed since
    college in Minnesota to explore how my faith works itself out on the front lines
    of culture through working in the arts.  I moved to Orlando in 1982 with SAK theatre,
    a company I co-founded.  Since then I’ve been able to help start and run various
    theatre and arts organizations and have been the Director of Arts & Cultural Affairs
    with Orange County since 2001. My wife and daughter are also involved in the arts.
    I love bringing people together to harness their creativity and to see people
    having dynamic experiences that enliven them.

- title: Eliza
  info: Eliza is working in Urban development, she knows the players and hosts conversations.
    If you want to get plugged into Orlando's Urban planning conversation, she's a
    great place to start.
  body: When I encountered urban planning in college, I saw how much the design of
    our cities affects our daily lives, our interactions with neighbors, and our communities'
    ability to thrive. Ever since then I have been 'seeking the prosperity of the
    city' (Jer 29:7) by working with colleagues and community organizations to the
    build cities and neighborhoods that encourage walking, biking, public transportation,
    environmental sustainability, and face to face interactions with neighbors from
    all walks of life. I work as an urban planner at Canin Associates and have served
    on the boards of Bike/Walk Central Florida and the Congress for the New Urbanism,
    the sustainability task forces for Orange County and Orlando, and the Community
    Workgroup of the Winter Park Health Foundation. My husband, Matt, and I live in
    the Mills 50 district and bike to the Cross whenever we can. I'm always happy
    to talk with fellow citizens about ways to make our city better.
