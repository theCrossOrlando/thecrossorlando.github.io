values:
- name: Story
  details: At the center of our people has always been the story. It reveals the character
    of God, memorializes what he's done and teaches us where to he can be found. It's
    significant to us that we remember the Scriptures are a story. It says so much
    about the nature of our God that he's preserved such core aspects of life inside
    a story, not a set of doctrines our list of instructions. It remindes us that
    his relationships with people are authentic and dynamic. So we value story; his
    and ours. We're always looking for the ways they intersect.
- name: Peace
  details: The peace of God is something that confounds the understanding of the world,
    it comes in relationship with him. We want the Cross Orlando to be a place where
    we run into that peace on a regular basis. It ought to be a marker of our congregation.
    Toward that end, we regularly encourage one another to remember the deep truths
    of the gospel. As those truths become guiding principles for our lives, we experience
    God's peace. It can overwhelm the areas of anxiety, fear, addiction and sadness
    in our lives. We can become ambassadors for God's peace just as our people have
    always been.
- name: Lineage
  details: 'The story didn’t start with us. As obvious as that may be, it’s easy to
    forget. But when we remember its ancient roots, it broadens the scope of our lives
    and communities. For generations and centuries Jesus’ expansion, explanation and
    fulfillment of the Jewish scriptures have been preserved and applied by families
    and followers. We enjoy being deeply rooted in those generations. Our community
    is built on three historic chief parts: the ten commandments, the Lord’s prayer
    and the Apostles Creed. Our understanding of those are informed by theology that
    emerged during the European Reformation and was outlined most clearly by theologians
    like Martin Luther and Martin Chemnitz. Our modest gathering started in September
    of 2010. Our mission is to bring Jesus to everyone by meeting the needs of the
    community and growing the faith of all who believe. We are partnered in the mission
    with four other churches in the area: Holy Cross, New City, the Cross East Lake
    and the Table of West Volusia.'
- name: Life
  details: Most of us don’t know exactly how we ended up here, but we’ve decided that
    it was no accident. For us, this city won’t just be the place where we live. It
    won’t merely be buildings we walk in and out of and streets we drive on. If our
    mission is to live with love and joy, then Orlando will be our mission field.
    We will engage the people and structures of Orlando with the best parts of ourselves.
    We’re doing that as we start companies and non-profits, advocate for local businesses,
    raise children, cultivate friendships, serve, love, contribute. Orlando will be
    different because we’re here. We’ve found that we come by this attitude naturally.
    Our people have always contributed to the good of the places where they live.
    In our scriptures, we found the encouragement to, “Seek the peace and prosperity
    of the City to which God has taken you.”
